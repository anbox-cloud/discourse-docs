1.11.4 (November 1 2021)
========================

.. _new-features-improvements-1:

New features & improvements
---------------------------

None.

Bugs
----

A bug in the Anbox runtime caused random webview-based applications to
crash when upgrading the webview.apk to
`94.0.4606.80 <https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/10/chrome-for-android-update.html>`_.
For this reason, we downgraded the webview version to
`93.0.4577.82 <https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/09/chrome-for-android-update.html>`_
for stability, and we are planning to provide a fix in the Anbox Cloud
1.12 release.

==================

New features & improvements

No features were added in this release.

.. _bug-fixes-5:

Bug fixes
---------

-  LP #1927676 No image is imported in AMS when deploying 1.9.x based
   Anbox Cloud

With Anbox Cloud 1.10 packages are now version specific which allows
users to deploy older versions of Anbox Cloud while a newer version is
available. Due to a bug in AMS 1.9.x no images were imported as the 1.10
ones were always seen as newer (when ``images.version_lockstep`` is set
to ``true``) and older 1.9.x images were not considered. With 1.9.5 AMS
will now correctly download the latest 1.9.x image and ignore any newer
one.

Existing deployments based on 1.9.x are not affected by this bug.

[/Details]

[Details=1.10.0]

1.10.0 (May 6 2021)
===================

.. _new-features-improvements-10:

New features & improvements
---------------------------

-  Android 11 was released back in 2020 by Google and is now available
   and fully supported in Anbox Cloud. With Android 11 various `new features <https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/features>`_
   become available for developers and applications. From an Anbox
   perspective Android 11 provides the same feature set as for the
   existing Android 10 images and will be provided with monthly security
   updates starting with 1.10.1
-  In earlier Anbox Cloud versions the Juju charms and bundles for Anbox
   Cloud where only available after whitelisting user accounts for
   access. With 1.10 all charms and bundles are not available in the
   public on the Juju Charmstore. You can see all available charms and
   bundles `here <https://jaas.ai/u/anbox-charmers>`__.
-  Before 1.10 a deployment might have been automatically updated
   through a system package update to the next major or minor version of
   Anbox Cloud. With 1.10 this is no longer possible and upgrading to a
   new minor version of Anbox Cloud requires an explicit update to a
   newer charm as specified in `component versions <https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/component-versions>`_.
-  Up until 1.10 streaming sessions managed by the Anbox Stream Gateway
   could be joined but new clients had to wait before an existing client
   disconnected to establish a connection. With 1.10 the Anbox Stream
   Gateway has gotten a new API which allows to force disconnect any
   currently connected client from an active session.
-  With 1.10 Anbox Cloud now by default uses the `server optimized Nvidia GPU drivers <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-460-server>`_
   as packaged in the Ubuntu archive by default on amd64 systems. On
   arm64 systems the Nvidia drivers are still coming from the Nvidia
   provided `CUDA archive <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`_.
-  Applications can now be managed from the Anbox Cloud Dashboard. The
   feature was already available in 1.9 but disabled by default due to a
   few limitations. As part of 1.10 this is now fully available by
   default and allows the creation, modification and deletion of
   applications via simple web based user interface.
-  If a container has multiple service endpoints defined, allocation of
   node ports is now quicker. For containers with a high number of
   service endpoints (100+) the startup time was delayed by more than 70
   seconds and is now down to a couple of seconds at maximum.
-  A ``juju crashdump`` now collects additional debug information from
   LXD and AMS about available containers, addons, applications and
   cluster configuration
-  The LLVMPipe software renderer used by Anbox as part of the
   ``swrast`` and ``webrtc`` platforms is now limited in the number of
   threads it creates for rendering to the number of vCPUs which are
   assigned to the container. This helps to improve its efficiency and
   adjusts performance to match the assigned vCPUs.
-  Webview based on `upstream 90.0.4430.91 release <https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/04/chrome-for-android-update_27.html>`__

.. _known-issues-1:

Known issues
------------

-  With 1.10.0 Juju 2.9 is not yet fully supported. It is recommended to
   stick to Juju 2.8 until explicit support for Juju 2.9 is added and
   called out in the release notes.

[Details=1.9.4]

1.9.4 (May 3 2021)
==================

.. _new-features-improvements-11:

New features & improvements
---------------------------

The 1.9.4 release adapts the AMS service to work with LXD newer than
4.0.5. LXD recently changed which certificate is being used on the API
endpoint when running clustered. With newer LXD versions AMS fails to
setup the initial LXD node within a cluster. For subsequently added
nodes the problem does not exist. With the 1.9.4 release AMS now
correctly uses the new certificate used by LXD and allows the initial
LXD cluster bootstrap to succeed.

   longer be available starting with Anbox Cloud 1.10 which will be
   released in April 2021
-  The UI included in the Anbox Stream Gateway service will be dropped
   in Anbox Cloud 1.10 as it’s being replaced with the new dashboard

.. _known-issues-2:

Known issues
------------

-  At times the ``anbox-cloud-dashboard`` charm reports a ``error`` as
   workload status due to too many units trying to use ``apt`` on the
   machine at the same time. Juju will retry the installation after some
   time automatically and the problem will fix itself. The issue can be
   identified in the output of
   ``juju debug-log --include anbox-cloud-dashboard``. This will be
   improved in the upcoming 1.9.1 release
-  If for the initial deployment not Ubuntu Advantage token is
   configured via an ``overlay.yaml`` the status messages reported by
   the charms once they become idle is not set to ``UA token missing``.
   There is no impact in terms of functionality. Applying the UA token
   via ``juju config <application> ua_token=<token>`` will work as
   usual.

New features & improvements
---------------------------

-  New web based dashboard to manage applications and streaming sessions
   in Anbox Cloud
-  Webview based on `upstream 88.0.4324.152 release <https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/02/chrome-for-android-update_4.html>`_
-  Android security updates for February 2021 (see
   `here <https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-02-01>`__
   for more details)
-  Out of band data allowing to send custom data from applications
   running inside the Android container to the client connected over
   WebRTC
-  Support for streaming the clients camera to the Android container
   over WebRTC
-  Hardware video encoding support for Nvidia on Arm
-  Support in AMS for existing LXD clusters
-  New recursive= parameter to GET /sessions on the Stream Gateway to
   return the full session objects rather than just their ID
-  Streaming sessions can now be deleted in batch and asynchronously
-  Introduce the container.features config item in AMS to enable
   specified features in Android container
-  Bump key size to 4096 to work with 20.04 stronger security defaults
-  Anbox now uses Vulkan as a backend renderer API on Nvidia GPUs on
   both x86 and Arm. This improves performance, stability and
   compatibility.
-  Improved density on Nvidia Tesla T4 cards. With Anbox Cloud < 1.9.0
   the maximum of containers possible was around 10-12 due to bugs in
   the GPU firmware when using the OpenGL ES client API. With the switch
   to Vulkan the firmware bugs are no longer triggered and up to a
   maximum of 32 simultaneous containers are possible (subject to their
   actual use of the GPU)
-  Updated Nvidia GPU driver to the 460 series for both x86 and Arm
-  A default virtual keyboard is now included in the provided Android
   images and can be conditionally enabled
-  A launch activity can now be specified when new sessions are created
   or existing joined. This allows switching to specific activities
   within the application.
-  Stripped down unnecessary dependencies to speed up deployment time
-  Session objects in the gateway now contain information about failed
   container
-  The AMS charm now sets up access to the Anbox Cloud image server via
   the Ubuntu Advantage subscription the machine is attached to. It’s no
   longer necessary to supply individual user+password authentication
   details
-  Added API measurements to metrics
-  Various fields of an application can now be updated via the AMS HTTP
   API without providing a new APK file
-  The Anbox Stream Gateway has now support for HTTP rate limit which
   can be configured via a charm configuration option
-  AMS can be configured to use pre-existing storage pools and networks
-  AMS now exposes the ``scheduler.strategy`` configuration item to
   allow choosing between ``binpack`` and ``spread`` strategies
-  AMS now exposes two configuration items ``node.queue_size`` and
   ``node.workers_per_queue`` to allow fine tuning how AMS processes
   container launch requests for optimal throughput
-  The Google STUN server is no longer used
-  Streaming sessions are now ephemeral by default and will be
   automatically removed when the container it belongs to terminates

[Details=1.2.1]

1.2.1 (April 2019)
==================

.. _bug-fixes-25:

Bug fixes
---------

-  Telegraf was restarted every five minutes which caused metrics from
   Anbox being lost.
-  Android framework crashed in
   `WifiManager.getWifiState() <https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager.html#getWifiState()>`_

-  Application updates failed due to limited cluster capacity. Base
   containers are now queued up and processed in order as soon as
   capacity is available.
-  AMS was not correctly finishing a container timeout on launch when
   restarted. On restart AMS now resumes the timeout.
-  Base containers are now correctly marked as stopped during the
   bootstrap process when the related LXD container is also stopped.
-  Fixed unhandled timeouts in the LXD API client implementation causing
   API calls to hang forever.
-  Added Android security fixes from April 2019. See the `Android Security Bulletins <https://source.android.com/security/bulletin>`_
   for more information.
-  Installing applications with an architecture not supported by the LXD
   cluster caused the installation process to hang. AMS now checks on
   APK upload if the APK can be executed by the available machines in
   the LXD cluster. The installation process was updated to not hang on
   unsupported APKs.
-  The Android webview crashed in specific scenarios with SIGBUS on
   ARM64. This was caused by unaligned memory access in the OpenGL
   translation layer inside Anbox.
