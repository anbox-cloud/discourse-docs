[Details=1.18.0]

# 1.18.0 (May 17 2023)

## New features and improvements

### Streaming improvements

* The Streaming SDK now reports well defined error codes.<!--AC-1307-->
* When the agent restarts, the container state is synchronised to the session state. This avoids the containers being stopped and sessions still being active after a reboot.<!--AC-290-->
* The freeze time is reduced during packet loss situations. <!--AC-1472 and AC-1473--> <!--Simon to provide a video cut of the before and after-->


### Dashboard improvements

* The new **Edit** button allows editing the node configuration.
* The sessions web page has pagination.
* Streaming on mobile matches the device resolution.
* Quick actions such as **Start**, **Stop**, and **Join** are available for the containers list view.
* Editing of `manifest.yaml` upon creating an application is possible using the dashboard.
* The general layout of the web pages and forms has been enhanced to improve user experience and accessibility.


### Anbox Management Service (AMS)
<!-- wokeignore:rule=master --> 
* The AMS node list output has a `master` column that is not user-relevant and is removed.<!--AC-1395-->
* The `unscheduable` configuration item for a node is corrected to `unschedulable`. The existing configurations using `unscheduable` are still supported to maintain backward compatibility but the configuration item `unscheduable` is deprecated as of the 1.18 release. <!--AC-1346-->
* In addition to creating applications or addons from a folder or a tarball file, you can create applications or addons using a file of `zip` format. This helps in optimising the performance of AMS.<!--AC-1500-->
* Container devices and resources are dynamically allocated/deallocated when starting/stopping a container for effective resource management by AMS.<!--AC-1506-->


### Other

* Investigations on performance improvements to our OpenGL translation layer revealed that on the decoding side, some workloads were spending between 23% and 30% of their total cycles allocating memory. It has now been reduced to account for only around 2.5% of their total cycle count. This could lead to lower power consumption, thereby lower costs and higher density. Such optimisation efforts are a work in progress and we will further tune them in the future releases. <!--AC-1411-->
* The Android development settings (which include an ADB connection) are enabled by default. Some applications require these settings to be disabled, which you can do with the `disable_development_settings` feature flag. Once set, this feature flag will be considered by all newly launched containers. <!--AC-1364 and AC-1379-->
* The host ICE candidate IP address is no longer shared with the remote peer. <!--AC-1487-->
* The Mesa driver is upgraded to the [latest 23.0.3](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2023-April/225982.html). <!--AC-1534-->
* The feature flag `android.allow_custom_android_id` is introduced to enable the Android container to use a custom Android ID. Add this feature flag upon application creation to identify users by their corresponding `android_id`. <!--AC-1520-->
* You can now start a stopped container that is in an `error` state.<!--AC-1438-->
* Since the NVIDIA package is being held from upgrading when performing `apt upgrade`, this leads to the drivers missing the security patch. A Juju action is implemented to simplify this manual upgrade and perform the NVIDIA drivers upgrade on demand. <!--AC-1436-->
* Android security updates for May 2023 (see [Android Security Bulletin - May 2023](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-05-01) for more information).

## Bug fixes

The following issues were fixed as part of the Anbox Cloud 1.18 release:

* The following timestamp issue was reported by Android framework:

    Choreographer: Frame time is 0.278502 ms in the future!  Check that graphics HAL is generating vsync timestamps using the correct timebase.
<!--AC-1354-->
* An agent that is highly available and deployed behind a load balancer is incorrectly addressed by the gateway because the gateway was addressing the agent for supervisor message by the agent id rather than the session id.<!--AC-1432-->
* Streaming the Anbox application fails because of an unreliable websocket connection. <!--AC-1433-->
* The user action buttons were not visible without scrolling when using the web dashboard on mobile. <!--AC-1566-->
* Anbox Application Registry (AAR) does not log authorisation errors <!--AC-1523-->
* On the **Containers** page of the web dashboard, the application name was not displayed for containers launched from a raw image. <!--AC-1559-->
* Vendor image browser activity identifies itself as Android WebView. This behaviour is not allowed by several web services.<!--AC-1488-->
* Initialising the Anbox Cloud appliance involves renaming the `/tmp` directory when the source and the location are not on the same device and this leads to a failure in the initialisation of the Anbox Cloud Appliance.<!--AC-1522-->
* AMS does not reflect the updated instance details after resizing the LXD node. <!--AC-1524-->

[Details=1.17.2]

# 1.17.2 (April 17 2023)

## New features & improvements

* The security patch level is set separately for the vendor and system images. This ensures that the security patch level set by the Android system always takes precedence over the one set by vendor image.
* Removed `ashmem_linux` kernel module to align with mainstream updates.
* Until now, the `linux-modules-nvidia-xx package` was held even if the `use_prebuilt_nvidia_kernel_modules` config item default was set to false. This has been changed so that the Linux NVIDIA kernel module package will not be held by default. 
* Android security updates for April 2023 (see [Android Security Bulletin - April 2023](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-04-01)).
* The Android WebView has been updated to [112.0.5615.48](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/03/early-stable-update-for-android_01850485126.html).

## Bug fixes

* [AC-1511](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1511) Gallery2 app crashed when editing an picture on Android 12 and 13.
* [AC-1494](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1494) The **Sessions** pane in the Anbox Streaming Stack dashboard showed only the sessions that were in *created* status.
* [AC-1486](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1486) Settings app crashes in SkiaPipeline::tryCapture
* [AC-1496](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1496) GPU render node name is not updated when it has changed.
* [AC-1493](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1493) The Grafana Anbox Cloud dashboard shows inflated metrics when there are multiple AMS nodes.
* The known issue in Anbox Cloud 1.17.1 that the security patch level for Android 10 was 2023-03-05 instead of 2023-02-05 has been fixed.
* For Android 11, the following two commits from the [latest security tag](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/tags/android-security-11.0.0_r65) are applied:
    - https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/0340c219c094cbd0a07600eac471cfeeaceba60e

[Details=1.17.1]

# 1.17.1 (March 16 2023)

#### New features & improvements

* To minimise reboot of a machine or stopping of all containers, an internal check whether the GPU driver needs to be updated is in place. This also presents a status to the user indication the need to reboot the machine after a GPU driver update. The users can also ask if a pending upgrade will require a machine reboot or containers to be stopped. 
* If the LXD charm is deployed on a machine that has an NVIDIA GPU installed, running the `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` command for the machine may upgrade the NVIDIA drivers, which accidentally suspends running containers with GPU support. Hence, the NVIDIA drivers are held from being upgraded until you upgrade the LXD charm using the Juju command. You can check if the NVIDIA drivers are being held from being upgraded and when required, you can update them manually. 
* Android security updates for March 2023 (see [Android Security Bulletin - March 2023](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-03-01) for more information). Starting this month, Android 10 will no longer receive security updates as Google stops providing security patches for Android 10. 
* The Android WebView has been updated to [111.0.5563.49](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/03/early-stable-update-for-android.html).

#### Bug fixes

* [AC-1380](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1380) Android system UI crashes due to missing permissions.
* [AC-1435](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1435) Connection timer stays alive after connection attempt failed.
* [AC-1447](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1447) Anbox runtime becomes blocked when stopped before being fully started.
* [AC-1444](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1444) The `quote` key code doesn't get handled in Anbox Streaming JS SDK when interacting with the container.

[Details=1.17.0]

# 1.17.0 (February 15 2023)

#### New features & improvements

* Enabling work of Vulkan support for NVIDIA GPUs
* Dynamic screen resolution support
* Start and stop for containers in AMS
* Various dashboard improvements
* Experimental support for software accelerated AV1 encoding is now available behind a [feature flag](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/ref/ams-configuration) (`experimental.force_av1_software_encoding`).
* Containers now connect to Anbox Stream Agent instead of Anbox Stream Gateway for WebRTC signaling.
* HTTPS fingerprint checks were added to the Anbox runtime for deployment scenarios where the Anbox Stream Agent is not deployed with a certificate signed by a trusted CA.
* Initial support for NUMA has been added to AMS. If a system has multiple NUMA nodes, AMS will select a node based on the locality of an additionally allocated GPU. If a container is not allocated with a GPU or if `cpu.limit_mode` is set to `pinning`, no specific NUMA is being selected.
* To allow scheduling containers for applications onto specific nodes in a LXD cluster, an application in AMS can now add a `node-selector` part into its manifest. This will tell the scheduler in AMS to schedule a container for the application onto a node only if it matches the criteria of the node selector. The node selector currently supports tag based selection only.
* Android still requires cgroup v1 but Ubuntu only supports cgroup v2 since Ubuntu 22.04. To still enable Android to function correctly, initial work for a translation layer to support cgroup v1 on cgroup v2 only systems via a new `anbox-fs` utility written in Rust has been added. By default, the translation layer is not yet enabled but will be in a future release.
* Libsoup based websocket support for WebRTC signaling has been replaced with a custom implementation providing better stability.
* The Android HW composer module based on Wayland is now in use for all supported GPU drivers (NVIDIA, AMD and Intel).
* Android security updates for February 2023 (see [Android Security Bulletin - February 2023](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-02-01) for more information).
* The Android WebView has been updated to [110.0.5481.61](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/02/early-stable-update-for-android.html).

* Unified the pointer input model by using pointer events to handle mouse and touch events.
* Switched the memory allocator from `glibc` (the default) to `tcmalloc`, to decrease the memory footprint and optimise the memory consumption for the Anbox session.
* Added Android security updates for May 2022 (see [Android Security Bulletin - May 2022](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2022-05-01) for more information).
* Updated Android WebView to [101.0.4951.41](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/04/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_26.html).

## 1.9.5(May 11 2021)

### New features & improvements

No features were added in this release.

### Bug fixes

* LP #1927676 No image is imported in AMS when deploying 1.9.x based Anbox Cloud

With Anbox Cloud 1.10 packages are now version specific which allows users to deploy older versions of Anbox Cloud while a newer version is available. Due to a bug in AMS 1.9.x no images were imported as the 1.10 ones were always seen as newer (when `images.version_lockstep` is set to `true`) and older 1.9.x images were not considered. With 1.9.5 AMS will now correctly download the latest 1.9.x image and ignore any newer one.

Existing deployments based on 1.9.x are not affected by this bug.

[/Details]

[Details=1.10.0]

## 1.10.0 (May 6 2021)

### New features & improvements

* Android 11 was released back in 2020 by Google and is now available and fully supported in Anbox Cloud. With Android 11 various [new features](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/features) become available for developers and applications. From an Anbox perspective Android 11 provides the same feature set as for the existing Android 10 images and will be provided with monthly security updates starting with 1.10.1
* In earlier Anbox Cloud versions the Juju charms and bundles for Anbox Cloud where only available after allow-listing user accounts for access. With 1.10 all charms and bundles are not available in the public on the Juju Charmstore.
* Before 1.10 a deployment might have been automatically updated through a system package update to the next major or minor version of Anbox Cloud. With 1.10 this is no longer possible and upgrading to a new minor version of Anbox Cloud requires an explicit update to a newer charm as specified in [component versions](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/component-versions).
* Up until 1.10 streaming sessions managed by the Anbox Stream Gateway could be joined but new clients had to wait before an existing client disconnected to establish a connection. With 1.10 the Anbox Stream Gateway has gotten a new API which allows to force disconnect any currently connected client from an active session.
* With 1.10 Anbox Cloud now by default uses the [server optimised NVIDIA GPU drivers](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-460-server) as packaged in the Ubuntu archive by default on amd64 systems. On arm64 systems the NVIDIA drivers are still coming from the NVIDIA provided [CUDA archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
* Applications can now be managed from the Anbox Cloud Dashboard. The feature was already available in 1.9 but disabled by default due to a few limitations. As part of 1.10 this is now fully available by default and allows the creation, modification and deletion of applications via simple web based user interface.
* If a container has multiple service endpoints defined, allocation of node ports is now quicker. For containers with a high number of service endpoints (100+) the startup time was delayed by more than 70 seconds and is now down to a couple of seconds at maximum.
* A `juju crashdump` now collects additional debug information from LXD and AMS about available containers, addons, applications and cluster configuration
* The LLVMpipe software renderer used by Anbox as part of the `swrast` and `webrtc` platforms is now limited in the number of threads it creates for rendering to the number of vCPUs which are assigned to the container. This helps to improve its efficiency and adjusts performance to match the assigned vCPUs.
* WebView based on [upstream 90.0.4430.91 release](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/04/chrome-for-android-update_27.html)

### Known issues

* With 1.10.0 Juju 2.9 is not yet fully supported. It is recommended to stick to Juju 2.8 until explicit support for Juju 2.9 is added and called out in the release notes.

[Details=1.9.4]

## 1.9.4 (May 3 2021)

### New features & improvements

The 1.9.4 release adapts the AMS service to work with LXD newer than 4.0.5. LXD recently changed
which certificate is being used on the API endpoint when running clustered. With newer LXD versions AMS fails to setup the initial LXD node within a cluster. For subsequently added nodes the problem does not exist. With the 1.9.4 release AMS now correctly uses the new certificate used by LXD and allows the initial LXD cluster bootstrap to succeed.

### Bug fixes

No bugs were fixed in this release.

[/Details]

[Details=1.9.0]

## 1.9.0 (February 2021)

### Deprecations

* The Android 7 (`bionic:android7:arm64` and `bionic:android7:amd64`) images are now deprecated and will no longer be available starting with Anbox Cloud 1.10 which will be released in April 2021
* The UI included in the Anbox Stream Gateway service will be dropped in Anbox Cloud 1.10 as it's being replaced with the new dashboard

### Known issues

* At times the `anbox-cloud-dashboard` charm reports a `error` as workload status due to too many units trying to use `apt` on the machine at the same time. Juju will retry the installation after some time automatically and the problem will fix itself. The issue can be identified in the output of `juju debug-log --include anbox-cloud-dashboard`. This will be improved in the upcoming 1.9.1 release
* If for the initial deployment not Ubuntu Advantage token is configured via an `overlay.yaml` the status messages reported by the charms once they become idle is not set to `UA token missing`. There is no impact in terms of functionality. Applying the UA token via `juju config <application> ua_token=<token>` will work as usual.

### New features & improvements

* New web based dashboard to manage applications and streaming sessions in Anbox Cloud
* WebView based on [upstream 88.0.4324.152 release](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/02/chrome-for-android-update_4.html)

* Improved density on NVIDIA Tesla T4 cards. With Anbox Cloud < 1.9.0 the maximum of containers possible was around 10-12 due to bugs in the GPU firmware when using the OpenGL ES client API. With the switch to Vulkan the firmware bugs are no longer triggered and up to a maximum of 32 simultaneous containers are possible (subject to their actual use of the GPU)
* Updated NVIDIA GPU driver to the 460 series for both x86 and Arm

[Details=1.2.1]

## 1.2.1 (April 2019)

### Bug fixes

  * Telegraf was restarted every five minutes which caused metrics from Anbox
    being lost.
  * Android framework crashed in [`WifiManager.getWifiState()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/WifiManager.html#getWifiState())
  * Application updates failed due to limited cluster capacity. Base containers
    are now queued up and processed in order as soon as capacity is available.
  * AMS was not correctly finishing a container timeout on launch when restarted. On
    restart AMS now resumes the timeout.
  * Base containers are now correctly marked as stopped during the bootstrap process
    when the related LXD container is also stopped.
  * Fixed unhandled timeouts in the LXD API client implementation causing API calls
    to stall forever.
  * Added Android security fixes from April 2019. See the
    [Android Security Bulletins](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin) for more information.
  * Installing applications with an architecture not supported by the LXD cluster caused
    the installation process to stall. AMS now checks on APK upload if the APK can be executed
    by the available machines in the LXD cluster. The installation process was updated to not
    stall on unsupported APKs.
  * The Android WebView crashed in specific scenarios with SIGBUS on ARM64. This was caused
    by unaligned memory access in the OpenGL translation layer inside Anbox.
