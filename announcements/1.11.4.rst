Please see `component

of updated components.

New features & improvements
---------------------------

None.

Bugs
----

A bug in the Anbox runtime caused random webview-based applications to
crash when upgrading the webview.apk to
`94.0.4606.80 <https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/10/chrome-for-android-update.html>`__.
For this reason, we downgraded the webview version to
`93.0.4577.82 <https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/09/chrome-for-android-update.html>`__
for stability, and we are planning to provide a fix in the Anbox Cloud
1.12 release.

Upgrade instructions
--------------------

This release does not include any charm changes. Only the images are
updated, and they are automatically synchronised to your Anbox Cloud
deployment via the Canonical image server. See `Manage
images <https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/howto/manage/images>`__ for details.
