Anbox Cloud documentation
=========================

Anbox Cloud provides a rich software stack that enables you to run
Android applications in the cloud for all kinds of different use cases,
including high-performance streaming of graphics to desktop and mobile
client devices.

Using container technology, Anbox Cloud is scalable from a
single-machine installation that can run scores of single Android
systems to an entire cluster of machines. It is based on powerful and
battle-proven software from Canonical like
`LXD <https://linuxcontainers.org/>`__ and
`Juju <https://jujucharms.com/>`_.

Core features
=============

-  Simple and straightforward deployment
-  Management of the container and application life cycle while
   optimising for high density, performance and fast container boot
   times
-  Platform integration tools to allow, for example, integration of
   existing streaming solutions
-  Support for both x86 and Arm64 hardware, providing the same set of
   features

See the `official Anbox Cloud website <https://anbox-cloud.io/>`_ for
more information.
