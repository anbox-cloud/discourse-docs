## Bug fixes

- [AC-1560](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1560):
  Currently starting the container from an `error` state drops the logs for the container. To inform the user of such a side effect, now a confirmation is required from the user when executing `amc start <container_id>` for an `error` container.
- [AC-1570](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1570): 
  Creating an application from a directory gives a vague error message (e.g `no such file or directory: /my-app`) which might not reflect the real reason for failure. For e.g in cases where the directory exists but the AMC snap cannot access the directory. Now an intuitive error message is shown in such cases with added information directing the user to check the snap access.
