### Introduction

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.12.5.

This release prepares for an upcoming Ubuntu kernel release on AWS. With the 5.13 kernel, which will be introduced on instances running Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) starting at the end of February, Anbox must be adopted to work with changes in the `/proc` file system and semantic changes to the mount system API. If you are running on Ubuntu with kernel version 5.13 or later, make sure you're using the 1.12.5 images. Using older images will result in Anbox and the nested Android container failing to start.

Instances running Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic) are not affected, because the latest kernel version for Ubuntu 18.04 is 5.4.

Please see [component versions](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/component-versions) for a list of updated components.
