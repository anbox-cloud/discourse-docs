### Introduction

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.9.4.

Please see and [component versions](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/component-versions) for a list of updated components.

#### New Features & Improvements

The 1.9.4 release adapts the AMS service to work with LXD newer than 4.0.5. LXD recently changed which certificate is being used on the API endpoint when running clustered. With newer LXD versions, AMS fails to setup the initial LXD node within a cluster. For subsequently added nodes, the problem
does not exist. With the 1.9.4 release, AMS now correctly uses the new certificate used by LXD and allows the initial LXD cluster bootstrap to succeed.

The only component updated with the 1.9.4 release is the AMS service. All other components are not changed and remain at version 1.9.3.

#### Bugs

No bugs were fixed in this release.

#### Upgrade Instructions
