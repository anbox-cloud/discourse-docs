New features & improvements
---------------------------

The 1.9.4 release adapts the AMS service to work with LXD newer than
4.0.5. LXD recently changed which certificate is being used on the API
endpoint when running clustered. With newer LXD versions AMS fails to
setup the initial LXD node within a cluster. For subsequently added
nodes the problem does not exist. With the 1.9.4 release AMS now
correctly uses the new certificate used by LXD and allows the initial
LXD cluster bootstrap to succeed.
