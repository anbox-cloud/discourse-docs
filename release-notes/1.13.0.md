## Introduction

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.13.0.

Please see [component versions](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/component-versions) for a list of updated components.

## New features & improvements

### OpenGL ES 3.2 support

After supporting only OpenGL ES 3.1 for a long time, Anbox Cloud finally adds full OpenGL ES 3.2 support for NVIDIA GPUs and software rendering. This added support provides increased compatibility with available Android games.

### Direct rendering for AMD and Intel GPUs

Since the beginning of Anbox Cloud, graphics APIs were exposed to the Android container through a
translation layer, and the actual execution of commands happened on the outside. With 1.13, Anbox Cloud enables direct GPU access inside the Android container for AMD and Intel GPUs based on the open source [Mesa driver](https://mesa3d.org/). This direct access provides better performance and stability and increases compatibility.

Currently, direct rendering is available only when using GPUs. In Anbox Cloud 1.14, software rendering will be migrated to direct rendering too.

Direct rendering supports OpenGL ES up to version 3.2 depending on driver and hardware availability. Vulkan support will be added in Anbox Cloud 1.14.
