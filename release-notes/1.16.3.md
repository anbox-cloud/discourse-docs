### Introduction

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.16.3. This release updates only the Anbox Cloud Appliance. However, if you run the regular Anbox Cloud and have Grafana deployed, an action is required (see below).

This is an out-of-order release to pin deployments of the Anbox Cloud Appliance to a new signing key for the Grafana APT repository.

Grafana Labs has published [a note](https://grafana.com/blog/2023/01/12/grafana-labs-update-regarding-circleci-security-updates/) where they announce the revocation of the current signing key of their APT package repositories. See the blog post for more details.

If the user chooses to add support for monitoring during the initialisation of the Anbox Cloud Appliance, the appliance installs Grafana and pins the APT signing key internally. This is needed to detect changes in the repository signature and to fail installation if the provided signature is not correct. Due to this, all new installations and updates of existing installations will fail until the new signing key is installed. The 1.16.3 release of the Anbox Cloud Appliance pins the new signing key from Grafana Labs, allowing installation and updates for Grafana again.

If you deployed the regular Anbox Cloud and installed [the Grafana charm yourself](https://charmhub.io/grafana), update the [`install_keys` configuration item](https://charmhub.io/grafana/configure#install_keys) to provide the new GPG signing key to the installation.

Please see the [component versions](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/component-versions) for a list of updated components.
