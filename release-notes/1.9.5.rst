-  LP #1927676 No image is imported in AMS when deploying 1.9.x based
   Anbox Cloud

With Anbox Cloud 1.10 packages are now version specific which allows
users to deploy older versions of Anbox Cloud while a newer version is
available. Due to a bug in AMS 1.9.x no images were imported as the 1.10
ones were always seen as newer (when ``images.version_lockstep`` is set
to ``true``) and older 1.9.x images were not considered. With 1.9.5 AMS
will now correctly download the latest 1.9.x image and ignore any newer
one.

Existing deployments based on 1.9.x are not affected by this bug.
