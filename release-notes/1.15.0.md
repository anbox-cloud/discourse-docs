## Introduction

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.15.0.

Please see [component versions](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/component-versions) for a list of updated components.

## New features & improvements

### Common

* All snaps are now based on the [`core20`](https://snapcraft.io/core20) snap, which removes the need to have older base snaps (for example, `core18`) installed on newer Ubuntu versions.

### AMS

* AMS now provides support for a [development mode](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/exp/containers#dev-mode) for containers. This development mode mainly turns off status updates for the Anbox runtime inside a container, which usually cause AMS to stop the container.
* TLS 1.3 is now enforced by default. This means that if you're running older images (< 1.15), they will fail to talk to AMS. You can temporarily enable TLS 1.2 support in AMS again by setting the `force_tls12` [configuration option of the AMS charm](https://charmhub.io/ams/configure?channel=1.15/stable#force_tls12).
* With the new `cpu.limit_mode` configuration, the default strategy that AMS uses to assign CPU time to a container via the Linux kernel scheduler can be changed to use CPU core pinning instead. See [the documentation](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/exp/performance#container-cpu-access) for more details and the caveats that each mode has.
* If AMS is behind a load balancer, it can now be configured with the address of the load balancer via the [`load_balancer.url` configuration item](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/ref/ams-configuration). This configuration will instruct containers to go through the load balancer instead of reaching out to the particular AMS instance that launched them.

### Anbox

* The [WebRTC streamer configuration](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/ref/webrtc-streamer) can now be customised. Currently, only the minimum and the maximum bitrate can be configured, in addition to some options specific to [NVIDIA NvEnc](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-video-codec-sdk).
* [Tracing support](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/ref/anbox-https-api#heading--10tracing) in Anbox now includes support for tracing the WebRTC stack as well.
* A new HTTP `/1.0/platform` API allows runtime configuration of the currently loaded platform. For WebRTC, you can now enable RTP trace collection and retrieve information about the current status of the streamer.
* Anbox now uses the recently released [LXC 5.0](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxc-5-0-lts-has-been-released/14381).
* The WebRTC streamer now allows streaming only audio, only video or neither of them, which can be useful in cases where only the exchange of OOB messages is needed. See the [JS SDK](https://github.com/anbox-cloud/anbox-streaming-sdk/blob/master/js/anbox-stream-sdk.js) <!-- wokeignore:rule=master --> for details on how to use this feature.
* Anbox now uses [`jemalloc`](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc) as memory allocator to improve its overall memory footprint.
* A new OOB version 2 implementation allows bi-directional communication with the Anbox container through the use of data channels. See [the documentation](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/howto/stream/oob-data) for more details. With the introduction of OOB version 2, the former implementation is deprecated and will be removed in a future Anbox Cloud release.

### Android

* Added Android security updates for August 2022 (see [Android Security Bulletin - August 2022](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2022-08-01) for more information).
* Updated the Android WebView to [103.0.5060.129](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/07/chrome-for-android-update_01510389319.html).
* Updated the Mesa graphics driver stack to [22.0.5](https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/22.0.5.html).
* The `ashmem` kernel module is now optional for all supported Android versions. Anbox Cloud will drop support for `ashmem` with the 1.18 release.

### Anbox Stream Gateway / Agent

* Updated Dqlite to its latest [1.11.1 release](https://github.com/canonical/dqlite/releases/tag/v1.11.1).

### Appliance

* The appliance now supports deployment on Ubuntu 22.04.
* The minimum required storage size is now 20 GB.

### Charms

* On Ubuntu 22.04, the NVIDIA driver is now installed from the Ubuntu archive on arm64 systems instead of from the NVIDIA CUDA archive.

### Anbox Cloud tests

* The WebRTC benchmark tool (`anbox-cloud-tests.benchmark`) can now:
  * Attach to existing sessions (`--session=<id>`).
  * Mark sessions to be kept alive after the benchmark is done (`--keep-session`).
  * Set the WebRTC log level to gain low-level insight (`--log-level=<level>`).
