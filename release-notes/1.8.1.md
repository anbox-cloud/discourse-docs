### Introduction

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.8.1.

#### New Features & Improvements

* Android security fixes from November 2020 (patch level `2020-11-05`, see [here](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2020-11-01) for more details)
* WebView update to upstream release ` 86.0.4240.185` (see [here](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2020/11/chrome-for-android-update.html) for more details)
* AMS now allows locking image updates to it's own minor version. For example if AMS is at 1.8 it wont pull a 1.9 image but only patch releases for 1.8. This can be configured with the `images.version_lockstep` configuration option
