## Introduction

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.20.0.

## New features & improvements

### Core stack improvements

* Introduced support for creating virtual machine instances for use cases that require a stronger isolation. With the 1.20 version, you can use both containers and virtual machines for your applications.<!--AC-1459-->

* Ability to change the Anbox Cloud configuration
* Simplified app version selection for new sessions
* Improvements to general design and layout
* Warning messages to improve user experience

### Other

* Android security updates for November 2023 (see [Android Security Bulletin - November 2023](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-11-01) for more information).
* The Android WebView has been updated to 119.0.6045.66.
* We have modernised the existing NATS charm to align with best practices in developing charms. The new NATS charm is available at https://charmhub.io/nats. When you upgrade your Anbox Cloud deployment to 1.20, use the following command to upgrade:

        juju refresh --channel=1.20/stable --switch=nats

## Deprecations

* The [`instance-type` attribute](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/24197#instance-type) is deprecated now. You can use the `resources` attribute to specify any custom resource requirements. In line with this change, the documentation also has changed the terminology from *Instance type* to *Resource preset* to indicate a defined set of resources.

## Bug fixes
The following bugs are fixes in the Anbox Cloud 1.20 version:

* Permission errors when Android tries to access cgroup. <!--AC-1748-->
* Missing support for VPU slots for `amc` commands. <!--AC-2004-->
