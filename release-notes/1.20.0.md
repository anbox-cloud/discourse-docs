## Introduction

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.20.0.

Please see [component versions](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/ref/component-versions) for a list of updated components.

## New features & improvements

### Core stack improvements

* Anbox Cloud has introduced support for creating virtual machine instances. This is especially helpful for use cases that require a stronger isolation. You can use both containers and virtual machines for your applications.<!--AC-1459 and AC-2010 and AC-1916-->
* The Anbox Management Service (AMS) snaps use [core22](https://snapcraft.io/core22).<!--AC-1853-->
* AMS downloads the image from the image server only at first use instead of downloading all available images. <!--AC-1158-->
* The watchdog can be enabled without specifying a boot package in the application manifest. <!--AC-2057-->
* The Anbox Cloud images no longer start `android.hardware.media.c2` services automatically.<!--AC-2033-->
* The included Mesa driver is tracking the latest 23.2.1 version and the `virglrenderer` is also tracking the latest upstream.<!--AC-1933-->

### Streaming improvements

* The required NVIDIA driver version has been updated from the 525 series to 535 series.<!--AC-1924-->
* Alpha quality support for Vulkan on NVIDIA GPUs is now available through a feature flag. To use this feature, you require newer NVIDIA drivers (versions 545 or later). Since the feature is at Alpha level, bugs and crashes can occur. If you are interested in early testing, contact us through the [users forum on discourse](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/anbox-cloud/users/148). Stable product support for this feature is planned for the 1.21 release.

### Dashboard improvements

With the 1.20.0 release, we have made the following improvements to the web dashboard experience:

* Improvements to session streaming statistics
* Ability to delete instances in bulk
* Ability to change the Anbox Cloud configuration using the web dashboard
* Simplified app version selection for new sessions
* Improvements to general design and layout
* Warning messages to improve user experience

### Other

* Android security updates for November 2023 (see [Android Security Bulletin - November 2023](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-11-01) for more information).

* We have modernised the existing NATS charm to align with best practices in developing charms. The new NATS charm is available at https://charmhub.io/nats. When you upgrade your Anbox Cloud deployment to 1.20, use the following command to upgrade:
