### Introduction

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.9.0

#### Deprecations

* The Android 7 (`bionic:android7:arm64` and `bionic:android7:amd64`) images are now deprecated and will no longer be available starting with Anbox Cloud 1.10 which will be released in April 2021
* The UI included in the Anbox Stream Gateway service will be dropped in Anbox Cloud 1.10 as it's being replaced with the new dashboard

#### Known Issues

* At times the `anbox-cloud-dashboard` charm reports a `error` as workload status due to too many units trying to use `apt` on the machine at the same time. Juju will retry the installation after some time automatically and the problem will fix itself. The issue can be identified in the output of `juju debug-log --include anbox-cloud-dashboard`. This will be improved in the upcoming 1.9.1 release
* If for the initial deployment not Ubuntu Advantage token is configured via an `overlay.yaml` the status messages reported by the charms once they become idle is not set to `UA token missing`. There is no impact in terms of functionality. Applying the UA token via `juju config <application> ua_token=<token>` will work as usual.

#### New Features & Improvements

* New web based dashboard to manage applications and streaming sessions in Anbox Cloud
* WebView based on [upstream 88.0.4324.152 release](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/02/chrome-for-android-update_4.html)
* Android security updates for February 2021 (see [here](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-02-01) for more details)
* Out of band data allowing to send custom data from applications running inside the Android container to the client connected over WebRTC
* Support for streaming the clients camera to the Android container over WebRTC
* Hardware video encoding support for NVIDIA on Arm
* Support in AMS for existing LXD clusters
* New recursive=<bool> parameter to GET /sessions on the Stream Gateway to return the full session objects rather than just their ID
* Streaming sessions can now be deleted in batch and asynchronously
* Introduce the container.features config item in AMS to enable specified features in Android container
* Bump key size to 4096 to work with 20.04 stronger security defaults
* Anbox now uses Vulkan as a backend renderer API on NVIDIA GPUs on both x86 and Arm. This improves performance, stability and compatibility.
* Improved density on NVIDIA Tesla T4 cards. With Anbox Cloud < 1.9.0 the maximum of containers possible was around 10-12 due to bugs in the GPU firmware when using the OpenGL ES client API. With the switch to Vulkan the firmware bugs are no longer triggered and up to a maximum of 32 simultaneous containers are possible (subject to their actual use of the GPU)
* Updated NVIDIA GPU driver to the 460 series for both x86 and Arm
* A default virtual keyboard is now included in the provided Android images and can be conditionally enabled
* A launch activity can now be specified when new sessions are created or existing joined. This allows switching to specific activities within the application.
* Stripped down unnecessary dependencies to speed up deployment time
* Session objects in the gateway now contain information about failed container
* The AMS charm now sets up access to the Anbox Cloud image server via the Ubuntu Advantage subscription the machine is attached to. Itâ€™s no longer necessary to supply individual user+password authentication details
* Added API measurements to metrics
* Various fields of an application can now be updated via the AMS HTTP API without providing a new APK file
* The Anbox Stream Gateway has now support for HTTP rate limit which can be configured via a charm configuration option
* AMS can be configured to use pre-existing storage pools and networks
* AMS now exposes the `scheduler.strategy` configuration item to allow choosing between `binpack` and `spread` strategies
* AMS now exposes two configuration items `node.queue_size` and `node.workers_per_queue` to allow fine tuning how AMS processes container launch requests for optimal throughput
* The Google STUN server is no longer used
* Streaming sessions are now ephemeral by default and will be automatically removed when the container it belongs to terminates
