## Introduction

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.17.2.

Please see [component versions](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/component-versions) for a list of updated components.

## New features & improvements

* The security patch level is set separately for the vendor and system images. This ensures that the security patch level set by the Android system always takes precedence over the one set by vendor image.
* Removed `ashmem_linux` kernel module to align with mainstream.
* Until now, the `linux-modules-nvidia-xx package` was held even if the `use_prebuilt_nvidia_kernel_modules` config item default was set to false. This has been changed so that the Linux NVIDIA kernel module package will not be held by default. 
* Android security updates for April 2023 (see [Android Security Bulletin - April 2023](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2023-04-01)).
* The Android WebView has been updated to [112.0.5615.48](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/03/early-stable-update-for-android_01850485126.html).

## Known issues

*  Some keystrokes are not picked up when interacting with the container. The keybinding doesn't work when you launch a session from the dashboard even if the application is built on top of the latest Anbox Cloud image. See [LP 2002536](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2002536) for more information.
