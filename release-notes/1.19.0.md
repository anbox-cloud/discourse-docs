## New features & improvements

### Core stack improvements

* The AMS API documentation created using OpenAPI specification is available on the AMS host at `/api/1.0/swagger.json`.
* Pagination and filtering support is enabled for containers and applications in the AMS API. This has made several dashboard enhancements possible. You can also use it if you want to interact directly with the AMS using API calls.
* AV1 hardware accelerated video encoding on NVIDIA GPUs is enabled.

### Streaming improvements

< List enhancements to streaming stack here. >

### Dashboard improvements

#### Registry
* When the Anbox Application Registry (AAR) is configured, you can view and manage applications and their versions in the registry. If you have configured the AAR in manual mode, you can also manually push apps to and delete apps from registry. Use the **Registry** option on the left menu to explore more about this feature.

#### Sessions
* The streaming statistics for sessions are enhanced. When you click on the **Statistics** button, the right pane displays the stream statistics and relevant graphs.
* The sessions list **Search and filter** feature is enhanced for easier filtering based on status and the region.
* You can now use the **Sharing** button on the session page to invite users without an account to join the stream using a link.

#### Applications
* An application detail page is added where you can see the details of the application and its versions. Click on the application name in the list of applications to view the application detail page.
* You can manage application versions through the dashboard now. On the **Versions** tab of the application detail page, there's an **Actions** button that allows you to manage versions of the application.

#### Containers
* You can perform bulk actions on containers on the containers list page. Select one or more containers for the **Start**/**Stop** buttons to appear on top.
* The container list **Search and filter** feature is enhanced for easier filtering based on status, type of containers, running applications, and the node on which it is running.
