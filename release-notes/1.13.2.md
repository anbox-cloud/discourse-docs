### Introduction

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.13.2.

Please see [component versions](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/component-versions) for a list of updated components.

#### New features & improvements

 * Android security updates for April 2022 (see [Android Security Bulletin - April 2022](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2022-04-01) for more information)
 * Android WebView has been updated to [100.0.4896.79](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/04/chrome-for-android-update.html)

#### Addons - hook timeout

Addons can now specify an overall timeout for their hooks by setting the `hooks.timeout` key in the `manifest.yaml`. An example
`manifest.yaml` will look like

```
name: my-addon
hooks:
  timeout: 15m
```

The timeout will not affect the timeout AMS applies to the overall container bootstrap process.

#### SDK - rotation support

The JavaScript Anbox Streaming SDK now provides a  `rotate()` method to tell the Android instance to rotate it's screen. The rotation
will be also visually applied to the HTML element containing the stream video. When the stream is rotated input events will be correctly translated.
