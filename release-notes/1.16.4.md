### Introduction

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.16.4.

This is an out-of-order release to mitigate a bug found with newer versions of LXD, specifically the 5.0.2 update to the 5.0 LTS release series. The bug prevents containers from starting when LXD 5.0.2 is installed. If you're running LXD 5.0.2, you must update the Anbox image that you're using.

Please see the [component versions](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/component-versions) for a list of updated components.
