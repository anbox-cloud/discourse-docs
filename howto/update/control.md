For security reasons, you should keep your systems up-to-date at all times. To ensure this, [snaps](https://snapcraft.io/about) update automatically, and the snap daemon is by default configured to check for updates four times a day.

In a production environment, this update behaviour might cause problems in some cases. For example:

- snapd might automatically update the Anbox Cloud Appliance to a version that is not backward compatible.
- snapd might automatically update the snap of a prerequisite that is not compatible with the current version of Anbox Cloud.
- Different nodes of an Anbox Cloud or LXD cluster might end up running different snap versions.

To prevent such problems, you should define maintenance windows in which your systems can be updated without interrupting operations. See [Managing updates](https://snapcraft.io/docs/keeping-snaps-up-to-date) in the snap documentation for information on how to control snap updates on your systems.

Alternatively, you can configure a [Snap Store Proxy](https://docs.ubuntu.com/snap-store-proxy/). Such a proxy makes it possible to control which snaps are served to the machines that use the proxy. In particular, you can use the proxy to [override snap revisions](https://docs.ubuntu.com/snap-store-proxy/en/overrides). With this method, you have full control over when snaps are updated.
