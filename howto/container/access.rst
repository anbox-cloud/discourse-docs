How to access a container
=========================

In some cases, it might be necessary to access an individual container
for debugging reasons.

You can do this on the command line with the ``amc`` command, or you can
use `scrcpy <https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy>`_ for graphical
access.

Access a container with ``amc``
===============================

The ``amc`` command provides simple shell access to any container
managed by AMS. To access a specific container you only need its ID:

::

   amc shell <id>

This command opens a bash shell inside the container. To access the
nested Android container, use the ``anbox-shell`` command inside the new
shell. If you combined the ``anbox-shell`` command with ``amc exec``,
you can get direct access to the Android container:

::

   amc exec <id> -- anbox-shell

If you only want to watch the Android log output, use the following
command:

::

   amc exec <id> -- anbox-shell logcat

``amc shell`` and ``amc exec`` open various possibilities for automation
use cases. See the help output of the commands for further details.

.. _howto_container_access-scrcpy:

Access a container with scrcpy
==============================

The AMS services enable connecting remotely over a network to containers
via `scrcpy <https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy>`_. Scrcpy provides a
simple way to display and control containers running on Anbox Cloud
remotely.

In the next sections, you will learn how to connect a container running
on Anbox Cloud via scrcpy.

Install scrcpy
--------------

Scrcpy is not available from the official Ubuntu repositories.
Therefore, you must install scrcpy in one of the following ways:

-  Build scrcpy from the source by following the official
   `guide <https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/BUILD.md>`_

-  Install scrcpy from the `Ubuntu snap store <https://snapcraft.io>`_:

   ::

        sudo snap install scrcpy

   .. note::
      The scrcpy snap package that
      is published to snap store is a non-official package. You can use it,
      but it’s at your own risk. Because of this, it’s highly recommended
      to build scrcpy from source by yourself.

Launch container
----------------

To interact with scrcpy, each container must be leveraging proper
graphics drivers to work. At best the container is launched with a
platform that has a proper GPU supported if the deployment includes the
:ref:`GPU support <exp_gpu-support>`.
Otherwise, you can use the swrast platform instead, which provides a
software rendering graphics driver based on
`swiftshader <https://swiftshader.googlesource.com/SwiftShader>`_. The
``swrast`` platform has been included in the official released images
that can be downloaded from an image server hosted by Canonical. We will
use the ``swrast`` platform in the following example.

First, launch a container with the ``swrast`` platform:

::

   amc launch -s +adb -p swrast -r default

The above command will launch a container from the default image. Since
scrcpy requires ADB to establish the connection between your host and
the container, the ADB service must be enabled by default. With the
leading ``+`` symbol to the ``adb`` service, it exposes TCP port 5559 on
the public address of the node.

Afterwards you can find the network endpoint of the container in the
output of the ``amc ls`` command:

.. code:: bash

   +----------------------+---------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   |          ID          |  APPLICATION  |  TYPE   | STATUS  | NODE |    ADDRESS    |                       ENDPOINTS                       |
   +----------------------+---------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | bpg8298j1qm4og61p7q0 |    default    | regular | running | lxd0 | 192.168.100.2 | adb:192.168.100.2:5559/tcp adb:10.226.4.200:10000/tcp |
   +----------------------+---------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

The endpoint of the ADB service exposed from the running container is
available at 10.226.4.200:10000 on the public network.

.. warning::
   Exposing the ADB service over the
   public internet brings security risks from having plain text data
   intercepted by third parties. It’s always preferable to run scrcpy
   :ref:`through an encrypted SSH tunnel <howto_container_access-ssh-tunnel>` if possible.

Run scrcpy
----------

Before running scrcpy to connect the running container remotely,
establish the connection between your host and the container through the
exposed ADB service via TCP/IP:

::

   adb connect 10.226.4.200:10000

After the connection is established, simply run ``scrcpy``, which will
return information similar to the following:

.. code:: bash

   INFO: scrcpy 1.10 <https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy>
   /usr/local/share/scrcpy/scrcpy-server.jar: 1 file pushed. 9.3 MB/s (22662 bytes in 0.002s)
   INFO: Initial texture: 1280x720

Then you can interact with the running Android container locally.

.. _howto_container_access-ssh-tunnel:

Through SSH tunnel
------------------

In the above example, the ADB service is exposed directly over the
internet. This is a major security risk as the ADB connection is not
secure. To overcome this security issue, you can use the machine where
AMS is running as relay server to set up a secure and encrypted SSH
tunnel by forwarding the exposed ADB TCP port from the LXD machine to
your localhost through the AMS machine.

To set up a secure connection, launch the container so that it doesn’t
expose the ADB service to the internet:

::

   amc launch -s adb -p swrast -r default

As the ADB service is enabled for the launched container but without the
leading ``+``, the endpoint 10.226.4.168:10000/tcp shown via ``amc ls``
is not exposed to the public network:

.. code:: bash

   +----------------------+---------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   |          ID          |  APPLICATION  |  TYPE   | STATUS  | NODE |    ADDRESS    |                       ENDPOINTS                       |
   +----------------------+---------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | bpg8298j1qm4og61p7q0 |    default    | regular | running | lxd0 | 192.168.100.2 | adb:192.168.100.2:5559/tcp adb:10.226.4.168:10000/tcp |
   +----------------------+---------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

Now forward any connection to port 10000 on your localhost to port 10000
on the remote LXD machine with the address 10.226.4.168 via the AMS
machine with the address 10.180.45.183:

::

   ssh -NL 10000:10.226.4.168:10000 ubuntu@10.180.45.183

In another terminal, you can connect the running container via ADB with
the following command:

::

   adb connect localhost:10000

Then run the scrcpy to display and control the Android container:

::

   scrcpy
