Update addons
=============

You can update an existing addon with a new version by using the
following command:

.. code:: bash

   amc addon update foo ./foo-addon

.. note::
   Due to Snap strict confinement,
   the addon must be located in your home directory.

AMS will update the addon and create a new version for all applications
that use this addon in the background. If the addon you are updating is
used by many applications, you might experience increased load on your
cluster while AMS updates many applications simultaneously.
