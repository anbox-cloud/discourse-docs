=============================
Example: How to install tools
=============================

Application images are designed to be as lightweight as possible, and as
such, common tools you might expect to see in a regular cloud image
might not be available.

You can use hooks to install packages that you require for your
application. In this example, we’ll install ``curl`` and ``python3``.

To do so, create a new addon with the following ``pre-start`` hook:

.. code:: bash

   #!/bin/bash -e

   # We only need to install things once when the image is being created, so we
   # don't need to execute the hook when users are running the application.
   if  [ "$CONTAINER_TYPE" = "regular" ]; then
     exit 0
   fi

   apt update -q
   apt install -y curl python3

When an application is created or updated with this addon, both ``curl``
and ``python3`` will be installed and made available for other hooks to
use.
