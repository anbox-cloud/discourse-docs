====================================
Migrate from previous addon versions
====================================

Starting with Anbox Cloud 1.12, the following hooks are deprecated and
should be replaced:

-  ``installed`` should be replaced with ``pre-start``
-  ``prepare`` should be replaced with ``post-start``
-  ``restore`` should be replaced with ``pre-start``
-  ``backup`` should be replaced with ``post-stop``

Be aware that the new hooks run for **all** container types. To execute
a hook for only regular or only base containers, use the new
``CONTAINER_TYPE`` environment variable. This variable is set to either
``base`` or ``regular``.

For example, if you want to execute a hook only when your application is
bootstrapped, you can do the following:

.. code:: bash

   if [ "$CONTAINER_TYPE" = "regular" ]; then
     exit 0
   fi

   # Rest of the code for your addon

.. note::
   Copying your existing addons without modifications might have unintended side effects, because your hooks will run for every container.
