How to test your application
============================

Anbox Cloud enables you to run automated tests for Android applications
at scale. In the following example, we make use of
`Appium <http://appium.io/>`_ to interact with a container running on
Anbox Cloud and automate UI testing for Android applications.

Setup Anbox Cloud for Appium
============================

As most deployments don’t include GPUs we’re going to use the ``swrast``
software rendering platform for Anbox which provides a graphics driver
based on
`swiftshader <https://swiftshader.googlesource.com/SwiftShader>`_.

If you want to automate the UI tests against an APK which is externally
provided, you can launch a raw container:

.. code:: bash

   $ amc launch -s adb -p swrast -r default

This will create a container which exposes the TCP port ``5559`` on its
private address from the default image ``default``. If you want to
expose ADB on the public address of a node, you can add the ``+`` from
the service endpoint specification. With that the command looks as
follows:

.. code:: bash

   $ amc launch -s +adb -p swrast -r

.. hint::
   If you’re wondering about the
   syntax of the command used to launch a container, see :ref:`howto_container_launch`.

If you want to run the Appium tests against an Android application
managed by AMS (see :ref:`howto_application_create`)
you can start a regular container instead:

.. code:: bash

   $ amc launch -s adb -p swrast --disable-watchdog app

.. hint::
   The ``--disable-watchdog``
   argument is important as by default Anbox prevents Android from
   switching its foreground application and terminates when the application
   is stopped. To prevent this we need to disable the watchdog which is
   responsible for this.

Once the container is up and running, you can get its private IP address
and the exposed port for the ADB service endpoint with the following
command:

.. code:: bash

   $ amc ls
   +----------------------+-------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+------------------------+
   |          ID          | APPLICATION |  TYPE   | STATUS  | NODE |    ADDRESS    |       ENDPOINTS        |
   +----------------------+-------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+------------------------+
   | bj0mpv0j1qm60tfotdrg | default     | regular | running | lxd0 | 192.168.100.2 | 192.168.100.2:5559/tcp |
   |                      |             |         |         |      |               | 10.226.4.168:10000/tcp |
   +----------------------+-------------+---------+---------+------+---------------+------------------------+

In the above output, the IP address and the exposed port of the running
container is ``10.226.4.168:10000/tcp``

Connect Appium with Android Instance
====================================

As the endpoint ``10.226.4.168:10000/tcp`` shown above is not exposed to
the public internet, the Android instance is not accessible from outside
of the subnet the LXD instance is on. To connect to the exposed ADB port
you have to setup a secure and encrypted SSH tunnel to the LXD machine
the container is running on. For that you should have an SSH client
available you can use to setup the tunnel.

On a Linux system you can setup a tunnel with the following command:

.. code:: bash

   $ ssh -NL 10000:10.226.4.168:10000 ubuntu@10.180.45.183

This will forward any connection to port ``10000`` on your localhost to
port ``10000`` on the remote machine with the address ``10.226.4.168``
via the AMS machine with the address ``10.180.45.183``. The AMS machine
here is used as relay server to establish the connection with the
Android container.

Now you can connect to the remote machine via ADB with the following
command:

.. code:: bash

   $ $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb connect localhost:10000
   * daemon not running; starting now at tcp:5037
   * daemon started successfully
   connected to localhost:10000

.. warning::
   Appium uses ADB as located in the
   Android SDK to establish a connection between the remote Android
   instance and the ADB daemon running on your machine. As mixing different
   versions of ADB is not supported you need to use ADB from the Android
   SDK in all cases. If you have the ``adb`` client installed from other
   sources, like the Ubuntu package archive, remove it first
   (``$ sudo apt purge -y adb``).

Execute Tests with Appium
=========================

Once the connection is established between the Anbox Container and your
development machine through ADB, you can launch the Appium desktop
application to execute test cases.

Manually provided APK
---------------------

If the APK file that you want to test is located in local folder or
hosted on a web server, add the following capabilities and save it as a
preset:

.. code::

   {
     "platformName": "Android",
     "platformVersion": "7.1",
     "app": "<apk_path>",
     "appActivity": "<activity_name>",
     "deviceName": "Android Emulator",
   }

The above preset accepts either an absolute path to an APK or a URL.

Finally you can start a new test session and run your test cases. For
more details about Appium, please refer to the `official documentation <http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/>`_

APK managed by AMS
------------------

If you want to run test cases without installing the APK every time when
starting a new test session in Appium, you can let AMS manage the
application for you. See :ref:`exp_applications`
for more details.

In this example we use the following application ``manifest.yaml``:

.. code:: bash

   $ cat << EOF > manifest.yaml
   name: app
   instance-type: a2.3
   EOF

Once the application is fully bootstrapped by AMS, you can launch a
container for it with the following command:

.. code:: bash

   $ amc launch -s +adb -p swrast --disable-watchdog app

After the container is up and running, you need to specify the proper
``appPackage`` and ``appActivity`` in the Appium preset, the installed
Android application will be launched automatically in the container when
a new session is created by Appium.

.. code::

   {
     "platformName": "Android",
     "platformVersion": "7.1",
     "deviceName": "Android Emulator",
     "noReset": true,
     "appPackage": "com.canonical.anboxtestapp",
     "appActivity": ".MainActivity"
   }
