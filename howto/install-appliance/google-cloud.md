The Anbox Cloud Appliance is not yet available from the Google Marketplace. However, you can install the Anbox Cloud Appliance snap on a Google Cloud instance by using this guide.

The entire deployment process will take 20-30 minutes, depending on the selected hardware and the network conditions.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the procedure,
* Check the hardware requirements for the Anbox Cloud Appliance [here](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/requirements#appliance).
* Make sure that you have a Google Cloud account and a project on Google Cloud to create the virtual machine.
* If you wish to use your own Ubuntu Pro subscription, ensure you have the Ubuntu Pro token for your Ubuntu Pro subscription. If you wish to use the Ubuntu Pro subscription offered by Google Cloud along with the virtual machine, this prerequisite can be ignored.

## Virtual machine setup

### 1. Create a virtual machine
Log in to [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com) and select the project for this deployment. Select **CREATE INSTANCE** in the **VM instances** page.

Select **New VM instance** from the options on the sidebar.

### 2. Configure basic settings

Configure the following basic settings for the virtual machine. For the settings that are not mentioned in this guide, you can choose to proceed with the default options or see [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance) to customise your virtual machine on Google Cloud.

* **Name** - Name of the virtual machine instance
* **Labels** - Organisational labels to keep track of your resources on Google Cloud
* **Region** and **Zone** - The geographic location where your resources are run and your data is stored
* **Machine configuration**, **Series**, **Machine type** and **Display device** - If your requirement includes GPUs, select the GPU-optimised machine configuration. You can select the recommended preset machine type or define a custom type.

### 3. Configure disks

Configure the boot disk by selecting **Boot disk > CHANGE** to choose the operating system and boot disk size.

![Configure boot disk|690x440](https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/d85bed8c-boot-disk-config.png)

Select the operating system. Google Cloud has two options - Ubuntu and Ubuntu Pro. If you have an Ubuntu Pro subscription already, you can choose Ubuntu and [attach your subscription](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/22681#attach-ubuntu-pro) manually. If you donâ€™t, you can choose the Ubuntu Pro option which will include a Ubuntu Pro subscription through Google Cloud. 

[note type="information" status="Note"]Remember that choosing the Ubuntu Pro option will have an impact on your pricing. The **Pricing summary** section provides the resource details and the associated costs.[/note]

Define your preferred boot disk size. We recommend allotting at least 100 GB of disk size.

For Anbox Cloud Appliance, adding an additional disk is recommended for efficient container storage. Under **Advanced Options > Disks**, Select **ADD NEW DISK**. Add a disk name and choose the disk size as 100 GB. For the other fields, you can choose your preferred value or proceed with the default values.

### 4. Configure firewall mapping

If you want to use a service account to map your firewall rules to the virtual machine, you can use the default service account with default access scopes under the **Identity and API access** section. This service account will be used when creating a firewall rule.

If you want to use specified target tags to map your firewall rules to the virtual machine, assign a unique network tag under **Advanced options > Networking > Network tags**. This network tag will later be used while creating a firewall rule.

### 5. Launch the virtual machine

Select **CREATE** to create the virtual machine on Google Cloud. For additional information on creating a virtual machine in Google Cloud, see [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance).

## Firewall setup

Before installing Anbox Cloud on the virtual machine, you should set up a firewall. By creating a firewall rule, you can control the incoming and outgoing traffic to your virtual machine. From the navigation menu, select **VPC network > Firewall**. Select **CREATE FIREWALL RULE**. 

You can create a firewall rule based on your networking requirements following the [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/using-firewalls). The following is an example firewall rule to enable access to the Anbox Cloud Appliance dashboard once the appliance is installed on the virtual machine. 

````
Name : anbox-cloud-appliance
Logs : Off
Network : default
Priority : 1000
Direction of traffic : Ingress
Action on match : Allow
Targets : Specified target tags
Target tags : foo
Source filter : IPv4 ranges
Source IPv4 ranges : 0.0.0.0/0
Second source filter : None
Destination filter : None
Protocols and ports : Specified protocols and ports
    TCP ports : 80,443,10000-11000
    UDP ports : 5349,60000-60100,10000-11000
````
The target tag `foo` will be used as the network tag in the virtual machine settings. This tag should be the same as the one that was specified while configuring the firewall mapping.

If you want to use the service account to map the firewall rule to the instance, choose `Targets` as `Specified service account` and use the service account configured in the virtual machine.

Select **CREATE** to create the firewall rule.

## Connect to the virtual machine using SSH

On the virtual machine instance page, connect to the instance using SSH. See [Google Cloud documentation on SSH in browser](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ssh-in-browser) for more information. 

## Initialise the Anbox Cloud Appliance

After logging on to the virtual machine, follow the [Install the Anbox Cloud Appliance on your local machine](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/tut/installing-appliance) tutorial to install and initialise the Anbox Cloud Appliance and to register with the dashboard.

[note type="information" status="Note"]If you choose Ubuntu Pro as your operating system, you can ignore the step in the installation instructions that guides you to attach your machine to the Ubuntu Pro subscription as the subscription is included with the Google Cloud resources. You can check the status of the Ubuntu Pro subscription by running `pro status`.[/note]
