We strongly recommend that you follow the [Install the Anbox Cloud Appliance on your local machine](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/install-appliance/22681) tutorial before you install the appliance on a cloud platform. The tutorial guides you through installing the appliance on your local machine and makes you familiar with both the installation process and the general concepts of the Anbox Cloud Appliance.

[note type="information" status="Note"]There is a difference between the full Anbox Cloud installation and the Anbox Cloud Appliance (see [Variants](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/anbox-cloud-overview/17802#variants)). This section focuses on the **Anbox Cloud Appliance**.
