When launching an instance, the instance should not be considered started until it reaches the running state. Sometimes if you want to interact with the instance (with the `amc shell` command, for example), you must wait until the instance reaches a `running` status.

The `amc wait` command allows to wait for an instance to reach a specific condition. If the condition is not satisfied within the specified time (five minutes by default), a timeout error will be returned by AMS.

The supported conditions for an instance are as follows:

Name            |  Value
----------------|------------
`app`           |  Application name or ID
`type`          |  Type of the instance, possible values: "base", "regular"
`node`          |  Node on which the instance runs
`status`        |  instance status, possible values: "created", "prepared", "started", "stopped", "running", "error", "deleted", "unknown"

For example, to wait for the instance to reach state `running`:

    amc wait -c status=running bdpaqaqhmss611ruq6kg
