====================
Control AMS remotely
====================

By default, the Anbox Management Client (AMC) runs on the same machine
as the :ref:`Anbox Management Service (AMS) <explanation_ams>` and connects
to it through a UNIX socket.

If you want to control AMS remotely, you can install the AMC on a
separate machine and configure it to connect to AMS through a secure
HTTP connection.

Install the AMC on a separate machine
=====================================

To install the AMC on a machine other than the machine running AMS, you
must first install it.

To do so, use the following command:

::

   snap install amc

Install a trusted certificate
=============================

Controlling AMS remotely requires trusted security certificates. You can
generate self-signed certificates or use certificates signed by a
Certificate Authority. See :ref:`Security certificates for remote clients <explanation_ams-security-certificates>`
for more information.

Self-signed certificates
------------------------

To use a self-signed certificate, complete the following steps:

1. Enter the following command on the client machine to generate the
   certificate:

   ::

       amc remote ls

2. Locate the ``$HOME/snap/ams/current/client/client.crt`` certificate
   on the client machine and copy it to the machine that runs AMS.
3. Log on to the machine that runs AMS and configure AMS to trust the
   new client by adding the client certificate:

   ::

       amc config trust add client.crt

Certificate Authority (CA)
--------------------------

To use a CA certificate, complete the following steps:

1. Generate a CA certificate and key. There are different ways of how to
   do this. For example, you can use a PKI like
   `easy-rsa <https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa>`_.
2. Copy the generated CA certificate to the machine that runs AMS.
3. Log on to the machine that runs AMS and configure AMS to trust the CA
   certificate (and with that, all certificates that are based on it):

   ::

       amc config trust add ca.crt

4. For each client, generate a client key and certificate based on the
   CA certificate. You should use the same method for this as you did in
   the first step.
5. Copy the generated credentials to the client machine:

   -  Copy the client certificate to
      ``$HOME/snap/ams/current/client/client.crt``.
   -  Copy the client key to
      ``$HOME/snap/ams/current/client/client.key``

Configure AMC to connect to AMS
===============================

After setting up the security certificates, configure AMC to connect to
the remote AMS. To do this, choose a name for the remote and enter the
following command:

::

   amc remote add <your remote name> https://<IP address of the AMS machine>:8444

.. hint::
   If you haven’t changed the port
   AMS is listening on, it’s 8444 by default.

The command connects to AMS and shows you the fingerprint of the server
certificate. If it matches what you expect, acknowledge the fingerprint
by typing “yes”.

Finally, switch to the new remote by running the following command:

::

   amc remote set-default <your remote name>

All invocations of the ``amc`` command will from now on use the new
remote.
