How to manage images
====================

An image is the base for a container running in the Anbox Cloud. It
contains all necessary components, like Anbox or the Android root file
system. Each release of Anbox Cloud comes with an updated image.

See :ref:`ref_provided-images` for
information about which images Anbox Cloud provides.

Configure image server
======================

Using the image server hosted by Canonical enables automated updates on
your Anbox Cloud deployment. AMS will automatically synchronise new
image versions in regular intervals and update your applications. Using
the image server should be preferred over using manually managed images.
Images on the image server are updated for important security updates or
bug fixes, and with every release of Anbox Cloud.

Starting with Anbox Cloud 1.9, access to the image server is
automatically configured as part of your Ubuntu Advantage subscription
during the charm deployment. No further manual steps are necessary.

AMS will start automatically to import images available on the image
server. The ``images.update_interval`` configuration option allows to
customise how often AMS looks for new images. You can set it to a
desired interval with the following command:

::

   amc config set images.update_interval 5m

Synchronised images will become available next to images you manually
add:

.. code:: bash

   +----------------------+-----------------------------+--------+----------+
   |          ID          |            NAME             | STATUS | VERSIONS |
   +----------------------+-----------------------------+--------+----------+
   | bj03g89hpuo10ed1riog | io.anbox-cloud:nougat:amd64 | active | 1        |
   +----------------------+-----------------------------+--------+----------+
   | bj003kphpuo2bt5edjtg | default                     | active | 1        |
   +----------------------+-----------------------------+--------+----------+

Default image
=============

When adding your first image to AMS, it is marked as the default image.
The default image is used when you create an application without the
``image`` field or launch a raw container without specifying any ID.

You can set any image as your default with the following command:

::

   amc image switch bcpm2r2hmss0427lkrn0

Running ``amc image list`` will now show this image marked as default.

.. hint::
   Note that you cannot delete an
   image marked as default. You’ll need to set a new default image first.
   *(does not apply if you only have one image left)*

Delete an image
===============

Deleting an image will make it unavailable to Anbox Cloud. However, it
will not affect any application based on the image directly, as the
application keeps a copy of the image internally. As the image is not
available to AMS anymore after deleting it, updating the underlying
image of applications with a new version is not possible anymore.

Deleting a specific image can be achieved with the following command,
where ``default`` is the name of the image to delete:

::

   amc image delete default

Images that are synchronised from the image server are marked as
immutable. To delete such images, add the ``--force`` flag:

::

   amc image delete --force io.anbox-cloud:nougat:amd64

If you’re not using ``--force``, the command will fail.

Delete an image version
-----------------------

Specific image versions can be deleted too, which is useful when all
applications were migrated to a newer version and the old version is not
needed anymore. The only requirement is that a single version of the
image is available at all times.

The following command removes version ``1`` of the image with the name
``default``:

::

   amc image delete default --version=1

Use a specific release of an image
==================================

With every new Anbox Cloud release, updated images are published. By
default, the latest image release is pulled by AMS, but you can request
a specific release with the following syntax:

::

   amc image add <local image name> <remote image name>@<release>

For instance, to fetch the arm64 Android 11 image of the 1.11.2 release:

::

   amc image foobar bionic:android11:arm64@1.11.2

You can then use the ``foobar`` image as you would any other image.

.. tip::
   Image updates contain important
   security patches and optimisations. Use older images only when strictly
   necessary.

Manual upload of images
=======================

In addition to the images provided through Canonical’s image server, you
can manually upload your own images to be used by AMS.

You must choose a name for the image when uploading it. If you update
the image later, use the same name so that the image is not re-created
but simply updated.

Add an image to AMS
-------------------

Adding an image to AMS can be done with the following command:

::

   amc image add default anbox-lxd-bionic_1.7_amd64.tar.xz

``default`` is the name assigned to the new image. The name can be used
by applications to reference the image.

Each image gets a unique ID assigned which can be used to retrieve
further information about the image with ``amc image show <ID>``:

.. code:: bash

   id: bcpm2r2hmss0427lkrn0
   name: default
   status: active
   versions:
       0:
           size: 374.69MB
           created-at: 2018-06-27 10:05:32 +0000 UTC
           status: active

Similar to applications managed by AMS (see :ref:`exp_applications`),
images have a list of versions too. A new version is created each time
an image is updated.

Update an existing image
------------------------

Use the following command to update a manually uploaded image in AMS:

::

   amc image update default anbox-lxd-bionic_1.7_amd64.tar.xz

``default`` is the name assigned to the existing image. Uploading the
new image to the connected LXD cluster will take a moment. Once the
upload has finished, the image is marked as ``active``.

Now that a new image version is available to AMS, it will start to
create new versions of all available applications but won’t publish
them. Creating new versions of each application can take a moment
depending on the current load of the cluster. You can see available
versions of a specific application with the following command:

::

   amc application show <id>

Each version will give information about which version of an image it is
based on.
