Anbox Cloud provides tools for benchmarking different aspects of your deployment. These tools enable you to put Anbox Cloud under load and use the results to evaluate the performance for a well-defined workload.

See [Performance benchmarks](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/performance-benchmarks/24709) for an overview of results that you can expect for selected hardware configurations.

[note type="information" status="Important"]Benchmarks provide useful information only if you run them with an application and workload that reflects your real-life scenario. For example, if you run the benchmark with an Android app that just sits idle and does not constantly refresh the screen by itself, you will get a low FPS number. This number does not reflect the real scenario though, because in reality, your users actually use the app and thus cause a higher workload.[/note]

## Run instance benchmarks

The `amc` command line utility provides a `benchmark` subcommand to run benchmarks on an Anbox Cloud deployment. It measures the time instances take to start up and their average FPS (frames per second) rate.

The results you get depend on the resources of the machines that host the instances. In addition, latency between the different nodes and the AMS services can impact the results

Check the help output to see all available arguments and their purpose:

    amc benchmark -h

The benchmark command launches the specified number of instances on the Anbox [`null` platform](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/anbox-platforms/18733) with the following default display specification:

 | Display spec            | Value |
 | ----------------------- | ----- |
 | Display width           | 1280  |
 | Display height          | 720   |
 | FPS                     | 60    |
 | Display density         | 160   |

You can configure a different display specification through the `--userdata` parameter when running the benchmark. The required format for the parameter varies based on the different platforms:

| Platform              | Required format of user data          | Example                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------  | --------------------------------------------------------  |
| `null`                | Comma-separated values                | <display_width>,<display_height>,<display_fps>,<display_density>  |
| `swrast`              | Comma-separated values                | <display_width>,<display_height>,<display_fps>,<display_density>  |
| `webrtc`              | JSON-based                            | {<br>"display_width": <display_width>,<br>"display_height": <display_height>,<br>"display_density": <display_density>,<br>"fps": <display_fps>,<br>"render_only": true<br> } |

[note type="information" status="Note"]If you're running a benchmark against the `webrtc` platform, make sure to specify `"render_only": true` to launch the instances in render-only mode. Otherwise, the instance creation will fail, because the `amc benchmark` command doesn't interact with the stream gateway for the benchmark execution.[/note]

### Example

This example demonstrates running benchmarks for containers. You can do the same for virtual machines following the same commands and procedure.
The following command launches 15 containers for the application with ID `bh2q90vo3v1lt1ft4mlg`:

    amc benchmark --fps --network-address=172.31.4.11 --num-containers=15 --containers-per-second=0.1 bh2q90vo3v1lt1ft4mlg

The output for this command could look like this:

```bash

## Run stream benchmarks

A benchmark for streaming requires more automation than just starting instances. Therefore, Anbox Cloud provides a dedicated benchmark tool for this purpose. The tool automates the following tasks:

- Create a streaming session
- Receive the video/audio stream
- Collect various statistics
- Optional: Dump the received stream to a local file

The benchmark tool is provided through the `anbox-cloud-tests` snap. Use the following command to install it:

    snap install anbox-cloud-tests

Check the help output to see all available arguments and their purpose:

    anbox-cloud-tests.benchmark -h

To run the benchmark, you must provide an authentication token for the Anbox Stream Gateway. Check [How to access the stream gateway](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/managing-stream-gateway-access/17784) if you haven't already created an authentication token.

If your Anbox Stream Gateway is behind a self-signed TLS certificate, you must specify the `--insecure-tls` option.

By default, the results are printed out as text. Alternatively, you can change the output format to JSON with `--format=json` and save the results to a file with the `--report-path=/path/to/report.json` option.

### Example

The following command runs the benchmark against an existing Anbox Cloud deployment:

    anbox-cloud-tests.benchmark \
      --screen-width=1280 \
      --screen-height=720 \
      --screen-fps=60 \
      --stream-dump-path=/path/to/stream/dump/output \
      --application=my-application \
      --url=<https:// URL of the Anbox Stream Gateway> \
      --auth-token=<valid auth token for the Anbox Stream Gateway> \

The output for this command could look like this:
