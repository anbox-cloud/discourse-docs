=====================
Use the web dashboard
=====================

The Anbox Cloud Dashboard offers a web GUI from where developers can
create, manage, and even stream applications from their web browser. The
dashboard is useful if you are new to Anbox Cloud or want a simple
management interface.

Starting in 1.9.0, the dashboard replaces the old Dev UI.

.. note::
   The web dashboard is more
   oriented toward developers than end-users. However, it only uses
   available APIs and SDKs, and can be a good example to build your own
   web-based platform.

Installation
============

The dashboard comes pre-installed when you deploy :ref:`Anbox Cloud with the streaming stack <howto_install_deploy-juju>` or
the :ref:`Anbox Cloud Appliance <tut_installing-appliance>`.
It sits behind a reverse proxy for performance and security reasons.

Usage
=====

To access the dashboard, go to ``https://<your-machine-address>/``.

.. hint::
   The dashboard uses self-signed
   certificates. You might see a warning from your browser and have to
   accept the certificates manually.

Granting access
---------------

Instead of implementing its own user management, the dashboard relies on
OAuth for user authentication. The only OAuth provider supported right
now is `Ubuntu One <https://login.ubuntu.com/>`_. Future versions of
Anbox Cloud will allow using other OAuth providers.

If you havenâ€™t registered an Ubuntu One account yet, you can do that at
https://login.ubuntu.com/.

Before you can log into the dashboard, you must register your Ubuntu One
account with the dashboard to grant it access.

Register a Ubuntu One account in Anbox Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On a regular Anbox Cloud deployment, use the following Juju action to
register a Ubuntu One account:

::

   juju run-action anbox-cloud-dashboard/0 --wait register-account email=<Ubuntu One email address>

You will see output similar to the following:

.. code:: sh

   unit-anbox-cloud-dashboard-0:
     UnitId: anbox-cloud-dashboard/0
     id: "157"
     results:
       Stdout: |
         Visit https://10.10.10.10/register?token=eyJ0...-Td7A to create the new user

Register a Ubuntu One account in Anbox Cloud Appliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you followed the instructions in :ref:`tut_installing-appliance` to
install the Anbox Cloud Appliance, you already registered your Ubuntu
One account.

To add more accounts, use the following command:

::

   $ anbox-cloud-appliance dashboard register <Ubuntu One email address>

Accessing the resulting link will create the account and ask you to
login via Ubuntu One. You only need to do this step once per user you
want to grant access to the dashboard.

The generated link is valid for one hour.

Creating applications
---------------------

Creating applications through the dashboard is done the same way as you
would do with ``amc`` (see :ref:`howto_application_create`).
Note that more advanced scenarios might not yet be possible via the
dashboard and require going through ``amc``.

Streaming applications
----------------------

The dashboard comes with in-browser streaming capabilities through
WebRTC.

.. note::
   The dashboard uses the :ref:`ref_sdks-streaming-sdk`
   under the hood.

You can select any application you previously created and start a
streaming session.
