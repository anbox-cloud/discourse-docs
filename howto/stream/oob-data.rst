=========================
Exchange out-of-band data
=========================

The exchange of out-of-band data transmission between Android and Anbox
(WebRTC platform) enables Android application developers to trigger an
action from an Android application and forward it to Anbox(WebRTC
platform). Once Anbox receives the action, as one peer of WebRTC
platform, the action will be propagated from the Anbox to the remote
peer(WebRTC client) through WebRTC data channel so that client can react
to the action received from the remote peer and respond accordingly on
the UI.

This document will walk you through how to send a message from an
Android application running in the container to the client application
developed with the Anbox Streaming SDK.

Android Application
===================

Add Required Permissions
------------------------

For the Android application running in the container, you need to add
the following required permission to the ``AndroidManifest.xml`` to
allow the application to send messages to the Anbox runtime:

::

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
       package="<your_application>">

       …
       <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ANBOX_SEND_MESSAGE" />
       …
   </manifest>

Any attempt of an application which lacks the
``android.permission.ANBOX_SEND_MESSAGE`` permission to invoke APIs that
are provided by the Anbox Platform Library will be disallowed and a
security exception will be raised.

Import Java Library
-------------------

Check out the `Anbox Streaming SDK <https://github.com/anbox-cloud/anbox-streaming-sdk>`_ from Github

::

   $ git clone https://github.com/anbox-cloud/anbox-streaming-sdk.git

To import the ``com.canonical.anbox.platform_api_skeleton.jar`` library
into your Android project, please refer to the official
`documentation <https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies>`_
on how to import an external library into an Android application
project.

Alternatively, you can follow the steps below:

Copy the ``com.canonical.anbox.platform_api_skeleton.jar`` to
project_root/app/libs directory (If the folder doesn’t exist, just
create it).

Edit the ``build.gradle`` under the app folder by adding the following
line under the dependencies scope.

::

   dependencies {
       implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
       …
       …
       implementation files('libs/com.canonical.anbox.platform_api_skeleton.jar')
   }

Send Message from Android
-------------------------

The following example demonstrates how to send a message with the Anbox
Platform API to a remote client:

::

   import com.canonical.anbox.PlatformAPISkeleton;

   public class FakeCameraActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
        ….
        ….
        public void onResume() {
           super.onResume();

           String type = “message-type”;
           String data = ”message-data”;
           PlatformAPISkeleton api_skeleton = new PlatformAPISkeleton();
           if (!api_skeleton.sendMessage(type, data)) {
               Log.e(TAG, "Failed to send a message type " + type + " to Anbox session");
           }
       }
   }

.. note::
   The length for message type is
   limited to 256KB and the length of data is limited to 1MB.

Receive Message on the Client
=============================

A client application that receives a message from the Android
application can be written in JavaScript, C or C++ by using the Anbox
Streaming SDK.

Web Application
---------------

For a web based application you can use the JavaScript SDK which you can
find at :ref:`Anbox Cloud SDKs <ref_sdks-streaming-sdk>`.
To receive the data sent from the Android application running in the
Anbox container you need to implement the ``messageReceived`` callback
of the AnboxStream object:

::

       let stream = new AnboxStream({
         ...
         ...
         callbacks: {
           ….
           messageReceived: (type, data) => {
             console.log("type: ", type, "  data: ", data);
           }
         }
       });

Native Application
------------------

For a native application you can use the native SDK from :ref:`Anbox Cloud SDKs <ref_sdks-streaming-sdk>`.
To receive the data sent from the Android application running in the
Anbox container you need to register a callback via the
``anbox_stream_set_message_received_callback`` method:

::

       ...
       anbox_stream_set_message_received_callback(ctx.stream, [](
           const char* type, size_t type_size,
           const char* data, size_t data_size, void *user_data){
         std::cout << "Received message from container type: '"<< std::string(type, type_size) << "'" << std::endl;
       }, nullptr));
       ...

With those, whenever a message is sent from an Android application, the
native application will receive the message and print it to its standard
output.
