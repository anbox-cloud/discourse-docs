How to validate the deployment
==============================

Anbox Cloud includes a test suite which allows the validation of an
Anbox Cloud deployment. It comes with various tests covering different
features of Anbox Cloud and can be used to ensure everything works as
expected.

The validation tests currently cover the following areas of an Anbox
Cloud deployment:

-  AMS

   -  Container creation and deletion in different configurations
   -  Expected images are present
   -  Configuration is setup as expected

-  Anbox Stream Gateway API

   -  Session creation and deletion
   -  Stress testing

-  Streaming

   -  Stream selected applications in different configurations from
      Anbox Cloud while ensuring performance is as expected

Install Validation Tests
========================

The validation tests are packaged as a snap and are distributed via the
Canonical snap store. You can install them via

.. code:: bash

   $ snap install anbox-cloud-tests

Configure the Validation Tests
==============================

In order to run the validation tests you need to generate a
configuration file for it first. The tests include and interactive
generator you can use to generate the configuration file:

.. code:: bash

   $ anbox-cloud-tests -generate-config
   Do you want to test AMS? [default=yes]
   What is the address of AMS? https://1.2.3.4:8444
   Generating TLS certificate and key for AMS ...
   NOTE: You have to register the certificate generated manually with
    AMS. See https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/manage/managing-ams-access for
    details
   Do you want to test the Anbox Stream Gateway? [default=yes]
   What is the location of the Anbox Stream Gateway? https://2.3.4.5
   Which API token should the tests use to talk with the gateway? xxxx
   Is the TLS certificate used by the gateway self signed? [default=yes]
   Which application should be used to test the gateway? my-test-app
   Do you want to test streaming from your Anbox Cloud deployment? [default=yes]
   Which application should be used to test the streaming? my-test-app
   Please save the following configuration to a separate file:
   services:
       ams:
           url: https://1.2.3.4:8444
           tls:
               key: |
                   ...
               certificate: |
                   ...
       gateway:
           location: https://2.3.4.5
           auth-token: xxxx
           allow-insecure: true
   suites:
       gateway:
           application: my-test-app
       streaming:
           application: my-test-app
           supported-modes:
               - width: 1280
                 height: 720
                 fps: 30
               - width: 1280
                 height: 720
                 fps: 60
               - width: 1280
                 height: 720
                 fps: 25
           execution-time: 5m
           allowed-fps-stddev: 5
           dump-path: ""
       ams:
           supported-architectures:
               - arm64
               - x86_64
           platforms:
               - none
               - swrast
               - webrtc
           instance-types:
               - a2.3
               - a4.3
           gpu-type: none

As mentioned by the command you have to store the printed configuration
to a file so it can be used by the tests later on. Also you need to
register the generated TLS certificate for the AMS tests with AMS. See
:ref:`howto_manage_ams-access`
for more details on how to do that.

Depending on your deployment you can further customize the generated
configuration. For example may your deployment only support a single
architecture for the containers. For that make sure the
``suites.ams.supported-architectures`` field is set to the right list of
architectures.

If you have support for real GPUs set the ``suites.ams.gpu-type`` item
to the right GPU type (supported values are: ``nvidia``, ``amd``,
``intel``, ``none``) and add GPU based instance types (see :ref:`ref_instance-types` for more
details) to the ``suites.ams.instance-types``.

Run the Validation Tests
========================

You can run the validation tests with the following command:

.. code:: bash

   $ anbox-cloud-tests -config config.yaml -ginkgo.v

If you want to focus on a specific subset of the tests you can specify a
focus for the tests:

.. code:: bash

   $ anbox-cloud-tests -config config.yaml -ginkgo.v -ginkgo.focus=streaming

The following focus areas are available

-  streaming
-  gateway
-  ams
