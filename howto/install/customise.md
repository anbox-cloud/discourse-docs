The [Deploy Anbox Cloud with Juju](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/installation-quickstart/17744) documentation explains how to perform a quick and easy general install of Anbox Cloud. However, in some cases it may be useful to customise the installation:

* Deploying on bare metal
* Adding additional components
* Configuring storage or networking
* Copying an existing configuration
* Testing a pre-release version

...and many more. This part of the documentation will help you with this.

## What You Will Need

The rest of this page assumes you already have Juju installed and have added credentials for a cloud and bootstrapped a controller. If you still need to do this, please take a look at the [Deploy Anbox Cloud with Juju](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/installation-quickstart/17744), or, for custom clouds (OpenStack, MAAS), please consult the [Juju documentation](https://jaas.ai/docs). In case that you want to deploy on bare metal, please have a look below.

Before you start, please make sure you read about the [requirements](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/installation-requirements/17734) Anbox Cloud has.

## Available Juju Bundles

To deploy Anbox Cloud, two different Juju bundles exist:

 * **anbox-cloud**: This provides the full Anbox Cloud stack, including support for streaming ([bundle.yaml](https://api.jujucharms.com/charmstore/v5/~anbox-charmers/bundle/anbox-cloud/archive/bundle.yaml))
 * **anbox-cloud-core**: This provides just the core elements of Anbox Cloud. ([bundle.yaml](https://api.jujucharms.com/charmstore/v5/~anbox-charmers/bundle/anbox-cloud-core/archive/bundle.yaml))

Each bundle as different requirements you can learn about [here](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/installation-requirements/17734).

If you don't have any need for streaming the visual output of the Android containers you can use the **anbox-cloud-core** bundle, otherwise you'll need the **anbox-cloud** bundle. However, even without the streaming stack there are still ways to get visual access for inspection purposes. See [Access a container](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/container-access/17772) for more details.

## Manual Deployment

If you don't want to use any public cloud, MAAS or OpenStack you can also use the [manual cloud provider](https://jaas.ai/docs/manual-cloud) Juju offers. This allows you to deploy Anbox Cloud with Juju on a set of SSH connected machines.

As preparation you need to dedicate one machine as the Juju controller. You can bootstrap the controller onto that machine via

```bash
$ juju bootstrap manual/<user>@<controller IP address> anbox-cloud
```

Juju will connect to the machine via SSH as the specified user and install all necessary things.

Once the controller is setup we need to create a model we can deploy Anbox Cloud into:

```bash
$ juju add-model main
```

Before we can deploy Anbox Cloud, we have to add all necessary machines. Please have a look at the [installation requirements](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/installation-requirements/17734) for the different machines you need.

To make things easier later on, please add the machines in the exact same order as mentioned in the [installation requirements](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/installation-requirements/17734). For the `anbox-cloud-core` bundle this looks like this:

``` bash
$ juju add-machine ssh:ubuntu@192.168.1.9
$ juju add-machine ssh:ubuntu@192.168.1.10
```

And for the `anbox-cloud` bundle:

```bash
$ juju add-machine ssh:ubuntu@192.168.1.9
$ juju add-machine ssh:ubuntu@192.168.1.10
$ juju add-machine ssh:ubuntu@192.168.1.11
$ juju add-machine ssh:ubuntu@192.168.1.12
```

[note type="information" status="Hint"]`ubuntu` is the user that can ssh to these machines, it can be another depending on how the operating system on the machines is setup. The user needs to have administrator rights on the machine.[/note]

[note type="caution" status="Warning"]Please make sure that you add the machine by their IP address rather than a DNS name. Adding a machine by its DNS name does currently not working and will be fixed with a future version of Anbox Cloud.[/note]

Juju now starts to add the machines to its list of usable machines. Take care that all are in the `started` state before you proceed. If any of them is still in `down` state, please wait until they switch to `started`. You can retrieve the list of machines registered with the Juju controller with the following command:

```bash
$ juju list-machines
Machine  State    DNS            Inst id              Series AZ Message
0    	  started  192.168.1.9   manual:192.168.1.9   bionic  Manually provisioned machine
1    	  started  192.168.1.10  manual:192.168.1.10  bionic  Manually provisioned machine
```

Now that the machines are registered with the Juju controller you can deploy Anbox Cloud. The deployment is entirely handled by Juju and does not need any further manual involvement other than running the actual deploy command.

For **anbox-cloud-core**:

```bash
$ juju deploy cs:~anbox-charmers/anbox-cloud-core --overlay ua.yaml --map-machines existing,0=0,1=1
```

For **anbox-cloud**:

```bash
$ juju deploy cs:~anbox-charmers/anbox-cloud --overlay ua.yaml --map-machines existing,0=0,1=1,2=2,3=3
```

To understand the `map-machines` parameters, please take a look at [Machine mapping](#machinemapping) section. If you strictly followed the instructions above you should have the machines registered correctly to match the command above.

You can watch the status of the deployment with a command like:

```bash
$ watch -c juju status --color --relations=true
```


<a name="machinemapping"></a>
## Machine Mapping

When executing the deployment instructions you have to map the existing machines with the ones described in the `anbox-cloud-core` or `anbox-cloud-core` bundles.

If you don’t remember the existing machines in your model, just type the command:

```bash
$ juju list-machines
Machine  State    DNS            Inst id              Series  AZ             Message
0        started  192.168.0.9   i-09a2fdb5e7a2e8385   bionic  localhost-1a   running
1        started  192.168.0.10  i-00a05065e2768be5d   bionic  localhost-1b   running
```

The deployment bundle `anbox-cloud-core` requires two machines `0` and `1`. `0` is supposed to host the AMS service and `1` is meant for LXD. For the `anbox-cloud` bundle you need two additional machines to host the extra services required for streaming. Please see the [bundle.yaml](#available-juju-bundles) of each bundle for more details.

The `--map-machine` argument for the `juju deploy` command maps the machines defined inside the bundle to those your Juju controller has registered in the model. See the [Juju documentation](https://jaas.ai/docs/charm-bundles) for more details.


## Customising the Deployment

A number of the scenarios outlined at the start of this document involved customising the Anbox Cloud install. There are two main ways to do this:

 1. Using overlays in conjunction with the published Anbox Cloud bundle.
 2. Editing the bundle file itself.

Using an overlay means you can easily apply your customisation to different versions of the bundle, with the possible downside that changes in the structure of new versions of Anbox Cloud may render your overlay obsolete or non-functional (depending on what exactly your overlay does).

Saving a copy of the bundle file and editing that means that your customisation will always work, but of course, requires that you create a new file for each version of Anbox Cloud.

Both methods are described below.


### Using Overlays

A *bundle overlay* is a fragment of valid YAML which is dynamically merged on top of a bundle before deployment, rather like a patch file. The fragment can contain any additional or alternative YAML which is intelligible to Juju. For example, to specify custom instance types for the machines used in your cloud of choice, the following fragment could be used:

```bash
$ cat overlay.yaml
machines:
'0':
  series: bionic
  constraints: "instance-type=m4.xlarge root-disk=40G"
'1':
  series: bionic
  constraints: "instance-type=m4.xlarge root-disk=40G"
'2':
  series: bionic
  constraints: "instance-type=g3s.xlarge root-disk=50G"
'3':
  series: bionic
  constraints: "instance-type=m4.xlarge root-disk=40G"
```

Juju's bundle format, and valid YAML are discussed more fully in the Juju documentation. In this example it merely selects a specific instance-types for the different machines.

To use this overlay with the Anbox Cloud bundle, it is specified during deploy like this:

```bash
$ juju deploy anbox-cloud --overlay ua.yaml --overlay ~/path/overlay.yaml
```

Substitute in the local path and filename to point to your YAML fragment.


#### Changing Configuration Values

Configuration settings are mapped to "options" under the charm entries in the bundle YAML. Usually these are only expressed when they differ from the default value in the charm. For example, if you look at the fragment for *anbox-stream-gateway* in the *anbox-cloud* bundle:

```yaml
anbox-stream-gateway:
  charm: cs:~anbox-charmers/anbox-stream-gateway-23
  expose: true
  num_units: 1
  options:
    enable_dev_ui: true
    prometheus_port: 10001
    use_insecure_tls: true
  to: ['0']
```

There are a few entries under `options`, in this case to enable the development UI and point Prometheus at a specific port. There are however, a number of configuration options available (more details are in [the charm documentation](https://jaas.ai/u/anbox-charmers/anbox-stream-gateway/64)). We can add additional configuration by supplying the desired settings under options. So, for example, where we might do the following through Juju to set some proxy values:

```bash
$ juju config anbox-stream-gateway https_proxy=https://proxy.example.com
$ juju config anbox-stream-gateway snap_proxy=https://snap-proxy.example.com
```

... we can instead use the following YAML fragment as an overlay:

```yaml
anbox-stream-gateway:
  options:
    https_proxy: https://proxy.example.com
    snap_proxy: https://snap-proxy.example.com
```

If we save the overlay as `proxy.yaml` we can now use it for the deployment:

```bash
$ juju deploy anbox-cloud --overlay ~/path/proxy.yaml
```


### Editing a Bundle

Another way to change or customise an install is to store the YAML bundle file locally and edit it with a standard text editor.

The latest version of the Anbox Cloud bundles can always be retrieved by fetching the current stable version from the Juju Charm Store. See [Available Juju Bundles](#available-juju-bundles) for more details.

Care should be taken when editing the YAML file as the format is very strict. For more details on the format used by Juju, see the [Juju bundle documentation](https://docs.jujucharms.com/stable/en/charms-bundles).


#### Retrieving a bundle from a running model

Sometimes a more convenient way of getting a local bundle file which matches exactly the deployment you want is simply to save a running model as a bundle. This will preserve configuration, relations and the charms used in the deployment so a structural replica can be recreated.

This can be done simply by running the command:

```bash
$ juju export-bundle --filename mybundle.yaml
```

The resulting YAML file will be downloaded to the current working directory.

It is also possible to view, edit and export bundles from the Juju GUI:

```bash
$ juju gui
```

Running this command will output some login information and a URL for the GUI interface (the GUI actually runs on the Juju controller instance). On visiting the URL given and logging in, a graphical representation of the current model will be shown. To export the model as a YAML bundle, click on the **Export** button near the top left of the screen.
