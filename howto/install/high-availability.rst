========================
Enable High Availability
========================

Anbox Cloud comes with support for High Availability (HA) for both Core
and the Streaming Stack. Next to `Jujuâ€™s support for high availability of the Juju controller <https://juju.is/docs/controller-high-availability>`_, you
can add HA for the :ref:`Anbox Management Service (AMS) <explanation_ams>` and the Anbox
Stream Gateway to ensure fault tolerance and higher uptime.

Enabling High Availability (HA for short) is achieved by `adding new units via juju <https://juju.is/docs/scaling-applications>`_. This will
allocate a new machine, run new instances of the scaled application and
configure the cluster automatically.

Adding a unit is done with the following syntax:

.. code:: bash

   $ juju add-unit <application name> -n <number of units to add>

For example, to go from 1 to 5 ams units, you would run the following:

.. code:: bash

   $ juju add-unit ams -n 4

.. hint::
   By default Juju allocates small
   machines to limit costs, but you can request better resources by
   `enforcing constraints <https://juju.is/docs/constraints>`_:
   
   ``$ juju set-constraints anbox-stream-gateway cores=4 memory=8GB.``
   
   This is heavily recommended on production environments.

Anbox Cloud Core
================

Anbox Cloud Core HA requires additional AMS instances as well as a load
balancer to spread out requests:

.. code:: bash

   $ juju deploy cs:~anbox-charmers/ams-load-balancer
   $ juju relate ams ams-load-balancer
   $ juju add-unit ams -n 2

.. note::
   If you are using the ``amc`` snap
   on your machine, you can tell it to use the load balancer instead of
   talking directly to ams:
   
   .. code:: bash
   
      $ amc remote add lb https://10.75.96.23:8444
      $ amc remote set-default lb
   
   

The port to use is always ``8444``, the same AMS is listening on.

Anbox Streaming Stack
=====================

.. warning::
   If you are upgrading from 1.4 or
   earlier, check :ref:`the upgrade instructions <howto_update_upgrade-anbox>`.

In the Streaming Stack, both the Agent and the Gateway can be run in HA.

.. code:: bash

   $ juju add-unit anbox-stream-gateway -n 2
   $ juju add-unit anbox-stream-agent -n 2
   $ juju relate anbox-stream-gateway:api anbox-stream-gateway-lb:reverseproxy

This would give you 3 instances of both the Stream Gateway and the
Stream Agent.

.. note::
   We recommend a minimum of 3
   machines for the Streaming Stack.

Checking status
===============

When adding new units, Juju will create new machine so it may take a few
minutes for your cluster to be fully operational. You can check
``juju status`` to see the current deployment status:

   ...

*Notice the ``scale`` of each application indicating how much units an
application has.*

Scaling down
============

Scaling down can be done by `removing units via Juju <https://juju.is/docs/scaling-applications#heading--scaling-down>`_.
Here you have to specifically target the unit you want to remove:

.. code:: bash

   $ juju remove-unit anbox-stream-agent/2

The cluster will reconfigure itself to work with the removed unit.
