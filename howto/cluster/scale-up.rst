Scale up a LXD cluster
======================

Scaling up a LXD cluster can be achieved via Juju. Juju automates the
deployment of the individual units and links them together.

Adding additional LXD units or removing existing ones is not an instant
operation. Adding a new node, for example, can take 5-10 minutes and
must be planned in advance. The deployment of a single node will include
the following steps:

1. Allocation of a new machine from the underlying cloud provider
2. Machine startup and first time initialisation
3. LXD installation
4. Registration of the LXD node with the existing cluster and AMS
5. Synchronisation of necessary artefacts from other nodes in the LXD
   cluster (for example, images)

To add additional LXD nodes, run the following commands:

::

   number_of_units=3
   juju add-unit -n “$number_of_units” lxd

This will trigger the deployment of the nodes. You can use the following
commands to wait until the deployment has settled:

::

   snap install --classic juju-wait
   juju wait -w

Due to internal implementation details, waiting for just the units to
settle and report status “active” is not enough. You must also check
that the unit is correctly added to AMS and is itself part of the LXD
cluster. You can do that with code similar to the following script:

.. code:: bash

   #!/bin/sh -ex
   unit=$1
   # Drop slash from the unit name
   node_name=${unit/\//}
   while true; do
     if juju ssh ams/0 -- /snap/bin/amc node ls | grep -q "${node_name}.*online"
       break
     fi
     sleep 5
   done
   while true ; do
     if juju ssh "$unit" -- lxc cluster ls ; then
       break
     fi
     sleep 5
   done

Save the script with the file name ``wait-for-unit.sh`` and run it with
the following commands:

::

   chmod +x wait-for-unit.sh
   ./wait-for-unit.sh "lxd/1"

The script just serves as an example and you should implement a similar
check in your auto scaling implementation. If you scale up with multiple
nodes at a time, your implementation should check for all new nodes to
be fully added to both AMS and the LXD cluster.
