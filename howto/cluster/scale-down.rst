How to scale down a LXD cluster
===============================

Scaling down a LXD cluster involves more checks than scaling up.

There are two important requirements when scaling down:

- The node you remove must not have any containers left.
- You must wait for a node to be fully removed before you can start removing another one.

Prepare the node for removal
============================

First, pick the node you want to remove and tell AMS to stop considering
this node for new containers:

::

   amc node set lxd0 unscheduable true

(Note that the typo in the command will be fixed in a future Anbox Cloud
release.)

Now the node won’t be considered for any further container launches.

The node might still have containers running. You can decide to either
kill all containers or wait for your users to disconnect. Use the
following command to check if the node still hosts containers:

::

   amc ls --filter node=lxd0

Note that a node must have no container left on it before you can remove
it.

If you want to kill all containers immediately, run the following
command:

::

   amc delete --all --yes

Remove the node
===============

When the node is ready to be removed, use the following Juju command,
where ``<id>`` is the number of the unit you are removing:

::

   juju remove-unit lxd/<id>

Once you invoke the removal of the node, you **MUST** wait for the node
to be fully removed before you attempt to remove the next node or add a
new one. You can do that with a combination of ``juju wait`` and the
following script (which is the inverse of the one for scaling up):

.. code:: bash

   #!/bin/sh -ex
   unit=$1
   # Drop slash from the unit name
   node_name=${unit/\//}
   while true; do
     if ! juju ssh ams/0 -- /snap/bin/amc node ls | grep -q “$node_name”
       break
     fi
     sleep 5
   done
   while true ; do
     if ! juju ssh "$unit" -- lxc cluster ls ; then
       break
     fi
     sleep 5
   done

Save the script with the file name ``wait-for-unit.sh`` and run it with
the following commands:

::

   chmod +x wait-for-unit.sh
   ./wait-for-unit.sh "lxd/<id>"

Once the unit is fully removed, you can continue to remove the next one.
