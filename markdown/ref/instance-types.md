In the same way as other clouds, Anbox Cloud describes the amount of resources that are available to a single container with an *instance type*. An instance type is a name that is mapped to a set of resources. This allows to have an easy abstraction when speaking about resource requirements of containers or particular applications.

Anbox Cloud offers the following instance types:
