.. _release-notes-1.9.0:

=====================
1.9.0 (February 2021)
=====================

Deprecations
------------

-  The Android 7 (``bionic:android7:arm64`` and
   ``bionic:android7:amd64``) images are now deprecated and will no
   longer be available starting with Anbox Cloud 1.10 which will be
   released in April 2021
-  The UI included in the Anbox Stream Gateway service will be dropped
   in Anbox Cloud 1.10 as it’s being replaced with the new dashboard

.. _known-issues-2:

Known issues
------------

-  At times the ``anbox-cloud-dashboard`` charm reports a ``error`` as
   workload status due to too many units trying to use ``apt`` on the
   machine at the same time. Juju will retry the installation after some
   time automatically and the problem will fix itself. The issue can be
   identified in the output of
   ``juju debug-log --include anbox-cloud-dashboard``. This will be
   improved in the upcoming 1.9.1 release
-  If for the initial deployment not Ubuntu Advantage token is
   configured via an ``overlay.yaml`` the status messages reported by
   the charms once they become idle is not set to ``UA token missing``.
   There is no impact in terms of functionality. Applying the UA token
   via ``juju config <application> ua_token=<token>`` will work as
   usual.

New features & improvements
---------------------------

-  New web based dashboard to manage applications and streaming sessions
   in Anbox Cloud
-  Webview based on `upstream 88.0.4324.152 release <https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/02/chrome-for-android-update_4.html>`_
-  Android security updates for February 2021 (see
   `here <https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-02-01>`__
   for more details)
-  Out of band data allowing to send custom data from applications
   running inside the Android container to the client connected over
   WebRTC
-  Support for streaming the clients camera to the Android container
   over WebRTC
-  Hardware video encoding support for Nvidia on Arm
-  Support in AMS for existing LXD clusters
-  New recursive= parameter to GET /sessions on the Stream Gateway to
   return the full session objects rather than just their ID
-  Streaming sessions can now be deleted in batch and asynchronously
-  Introduce the container.features config item in AMS to enable
   specified features in Android container
-  Bump key size to 4096 to work with 20.04 stronger security defaults
-  Anbox now uses Vulkan as a backend renderer API on Nvidia GPUs on
   both x86 and Arm. This improves performance, stability and
   compatibility.
-  Improved density on Nvidia Tesla T4 cards. With Anbox Cloud < 1.9.0
   the maximum of containers possible was around 10-12 due to bugs in
   the GPU firmware when using the OpenGL ES client API. With the switch
   to Vulkan the firmware bugs are no longer triggered and up to a
   maximum of 32 simultaneous containers are possible (subject to their
   actual use of the GPU)
-  Updated Nvidia GPU driver to the 460 series for both x86 and Arm
-  A default virtual keyboard is now included in the provided Android
   images and can be conditionally enabled
-  A launch activity can now be specified when new sessions are created
   or existing joined. This allows switching to specific activities
   within the application.
-  Stripped down unnecessary dependencies to speed up deployment time
-  Session objects in the gateway now contain information about failed
   container
-  The AMS charm now sets up access to the Anbox Cloud image server via
   the Ubuntu Advantage subscription the machine is attached to. It’s no
   longer necessary to supply individual user+password authentication
   details
-  Added API measurements to metrics
-  Various fields of an application can now be updated via the AMS HTTP
   API without providing a new APK file
-  The Anbox Stream Gateway has now support for HTTP rate limit which
   can be configured via a charm configuration option
-  AMS can be configured to use pre-existing storage pools and networks
-  AMS now exposes the ``scheduler.strategy`` configuration item to
   allow choosing between ``binpack`` and ``spread`` strategies
-  AMS now exposes two configuration items ``node.queue_size`` and
   ``node.workers_per_queue`` to allow fine tuning how AMS processes
   container launch requests for optimal throughput
-  The Google STUN server is no longer used
-  Streaming sessions are now ephemeral by default and will be
   automatically removed when the container it belongs to terminates
