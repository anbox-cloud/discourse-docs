Bugs
----

A bug in the Anbox runtime caused random webview-based applications to
crash when upgrading the webview.apk to
`94.0.4606.80 <https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/10/chrome-for-android-update.html>`_.
For this reason, we downgraded the webview version to
`93.0.4577.82 <https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/09/chrome-for-android-update.html>`_
for stability, and we are planning to provide a fix in the Anbox Cloud
1.12 release.
