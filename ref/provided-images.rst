Provided images
===============

Anbox Cloud provides images based on different Android versions and
different architectures (amd64, arm64). AMS manages these images, which
can be individually selected by applications. When an image is updated,
all applications using the image are automatically updated and rebased
on the new image version.

Officially released images are available from the `official image server <https://images.anbox-cloud.io>`_ hosted by Canonical.

.. note::
   Anbox images are regular `Ubuntu cloud images <https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/>`_ where Anbox and its
   dependencies are installed. Unnecessary packages are removed to improve
   images size, boot time and security.

Official images
===============

The official image server has a set of images available. The following
table lists all images and their corresponding Android and Ubuntu
versions. Please note the support status for each of the images.

The ``bionic:android7:arm64`` and ``bionic:android7:amd64`` images are
not receiving Android security updates anymore as Google stopped
supporting Android 7 in 2019. They are only provided for legacy reasons
and have been dropped with Anbox Cloud 1.10 in April 2021.
