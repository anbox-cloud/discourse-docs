The following benchmarks give an overview of the performance that you can achieve with Anbox Cloud.

The benchmarks were performed using the `amc benchmark` utility as described in [How to run benchmarks](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/benchmarking-a-deployment/17770). The results describe the maximum number of parallel running instances (column **# Containers**) delivering a stable frame rate (column **Avg. FPS**). Running more instances either gives a very high variation in the provided frame rate or is not possible due to other hardware limitations such as system memory, GPU memory etc.

For most of the benchmarks below, a special version of the [BombSquad](https://www.froemling.net/apps/bombsquad) application was used. This version runs in a demo mode in which the game provides random and automated simulated gameplay. This allowed the benchmark to simulate a real-world scenario where actual users would play the game, instead of deriving from a static game scene without much variation.

All benchmarks were performed with a variation of the following `amc benchmark` command:

    amc benchmark --network-address 192.168.100.1 -n <number of instances> \
        -p webrtc -f -s 0.1 --measure-time 5m \
        --userdata '{"display_width":1280,"display_height":720,"fps":30,"benchmark":{"enabled":true}}' \
        <app name>

[note type="information" status="Note"]All benchmarks include rendering and video encoding. On machines/VMs without a GPU, rendering and video encoding are performed in software on the CPU. See [software rendering and video encoding](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/17768#software-rendering) for more information.[/note]
