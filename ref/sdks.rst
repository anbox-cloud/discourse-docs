Anbox Platform SDK
==================

The Anbox Platform SDK provides support for developing custom platform
plugins, which allows cloud providers to integrate Anbox with their
existing infrastructure. The SDK provides several integration points for
things like rendering, audio or input processing.

For more details about custom platform plugins, refer to the `Anbox Platform SDK API documentation <https://anbox-cloud.github.io/1.10/anbox-platform-sdk/index.html>`_.

Download and installation
-------------------------

The Anbox Platform SDK can be downloaded via Git from GitHub:

::

   git clone https://github.com/anbox-cloud/anbox-platform-sdk.git

You need the following build dependencies:

::

   sudo apt install cmake-extras libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libelf-dev libegl1-mesa-dev

Examples
--------

The Anbox Platform SDK provides a collection of example platform plugins
to help developers get started with plugin development. The following
examples are included:

-  ``minimal`` - A platform plugin that provides a dummy implementation
   of a minimal platform plugin to demonstrate the general plugin
   layout.
-  ``audio_streaming`` - A platform plugin that provides a more advanced
   example of how a platform plugin can process audio and input data.

Anbox Streaming SDK
===================

The Anbox Streaming SDK allows the development of custom streaming
clients, using JavaScript or C/C++.

Components
----------

The Anbox Streaming SDK provides the following alternative SDKs:

-  A JavaScript SDK designed to help you get started with the
   development of a web-based client. This SDK handles all aspects of
   streaming, from the WebRTC protocol to handling controls, game pads,
   speakers and screen resolutions.
-  A native SDK offering a C API that provides the same full-featured
   video streaming as the JavaScript SDK, but aims for a low latency for
   your application based on Anbox Cloud. The native SDK is intended for
   C and C++ based applications. It currently supports Android and
   Linux.
