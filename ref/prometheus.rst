Prometheus metrics
==================

To see how to deploy a monitoring stack in Anbox Cloud, refer to the
instructions for :ref:`deploying Grafana <howto_monitor_grafana>`.
Those instructions will take you through the installation Prometheus and
Grafana.

The base installation provides basic dashboards. You can however update
them to fit your needs. Below is the list of all metrics returned to
Prometheus by each component of Anbox Cloud.

AMS
===

Metrics prefixed with ``ams_cluster_`` give information about the Anbox
management system (AMS). They keep you informed about the status of your
cluster.

HTTP Metrics
============

Anbox Cloud services that include an HTTP API are monitored.

.. _anbox-stream-gateway-1:

Anbox Stream Gateway
--------------------

A few metrics are available to instrument the API. Routes are indicated
in the labels, e.g.:

::

   anbox_stream_gateway_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="get_sessions",host="juju-2db13b-1",method="get",le="0.5"} 1

The route name would be ``get_sessions`` in this case.

Here’s the list of all routes and their corresponding label


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Description
     - Available since
   * - \ ``anbox_stream_gateway_http_in_flight_requests``\ 
     - Number of HTTP requests being processed at the moment
     - 1.9.0
   * - \ ``anbox_stream_gateway_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket``\ 
     - The HTTP request latencies in seconds
     - 1.9.0
   * - \ ``anbox_stream_gateway_http_request_size_bytes_bucket``\ 
     - The HTTP request size in bytes
     - 1.9.0
   * - \ ``anbox_stream_gateway_http_requests_total``\ 
     - Total number of HTTP requests made
     - 1.9.0
   * - \ ``anbox_stream_gateway_http_response_size_bytes_bucket``\ 
     - The HTTP response sizes in bytes
     - 1.9.0


.. _ams-1:

AMS
---

AMS can either be reached via HTTP/S or via a Unix domain socket. The
API metrics are separate between ``http``, ``https`` and ``unix``:

::

   ams_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="http_applications_GET",host="juju-2db13b-1",method="get",le="0.5"} 1
   ams_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="https_applications_GET",host="juju-2db13b-1",method="get",le="0.5"} 1
   ams_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="unix_applications_GET",host="juju-2db13b-1",method="get",le="0.5"} 1

This distinction gives a more granular approach to monitoring.

All handler names adopt the following convention
``<transport method>_<object>_<http method>``. E.g.:
``unix_containers_POST`` Here’s the list of all routes and their
corresponding label (ignoring the communication method prefix)
