This guide lists various supported GPU vendors, drivers, platforms, APIs and discuss the rendering pipelines used for different GPUs.

## Supported GPU vendors and GPU models

Being a cloud solution, Anbox Cloud is optimised for GPUs that are designed for a data centre. We currently support the following GPU vendors:

* NVIDIA
* Intel
* AMD

Do not mix GPUs from different vendors in a single deployment.

Concrete support for the individual GPU depends on the platform being using for Anbox Cloud. The included `webrtc` platform currently supports the following GPUs:

| Vendor | Model                 | Render | Hardware video encoder |
|--------|-----------------------|--------|-----------------------|
| AMD    | WX5100, WX4100        | Yes    | No                    |
| NVIDIA | Quadro, Tesla, Ampere | Yes    | Yes                   |

For GPUs on which Anbox Cloud doesn't support hardware video encoding, a software-based video encoding fallback is available.

Anbox Cloud is extensively tested using NVIDIA GPUs and occasionally, on Intel and AMD GPUs. However, if you want to use a different GPU vendor, you can customise and configure Anbox Cloud for the GPU vendor of your choice using the [Anbox Platform SDK](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/17844).

## Supported GPU drivers

For NVIDIA GPUs, Anbox Cloud uses the [Enterprise Ready Driver (ERD) from NVIDIA](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvidiaDriversInstallation) for Linux as available in Ubuntu.
For AMD and Intel GPUs, Anbox Cloud uses the [Mesa driver](https://www.mesa3d.org/).

See [Component versions](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/21413) to refer to the actual version supported for any particular Anbox Cloud release.

## Supported platforms

Anbox Cloud can make use of different [platforms](https://anbox-cloud.github.io/latest/anbox-platform-sdk/) to customise its behaviour and currently supports 3 platforms.

| Name     	| Behaviour                                                                                                                                            	|
|----------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `null`   	|  A headless-GL platform. No rendering is performed. No audio input/output. Useful for functional tests. It's used by default if no platform is specified when launching an instance.                                                                       	|
| `webrtc` 	| Full-featured WebRTC based streaming platform. Includes driver and integration for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs as well as LLVMpipe based software rendering if no GPU is detected.  Support audio input/output. |
| `swrast` 	| (DEPRECATED) Software Rasterization platform. A LLVMpipe based software rendering platform. Useful for visual tests. No audio input/output.    | 

For rendering, you can use the `swrast` or the `null` platforms depending on your requirements.

`swrast` is a software rasterization platform, which is a rendering implementation of the Mesa driver with support for LLVMpipe. It can be utilised for use cases that require a visual output without a GPU. The rendering pipe for the `swrast` or `null` platform is not different than the one for the `webrtc` platform with NVIDIA GPU support except that it is irrespective of any available GPUs. To know more about this implementation, see [LLVMpipe](https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/llvmpipe.html).

`null` is an OpenGL headless platform that makes use of the rendering backend of the [Almost Native Graphics Layer Engine (ANGLE)](https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle) and can be used when you do not need a graphic output, such as, automation testing. It does not perform software rendering and does not produce any graphic output. Hence, the overhead on the CPU when using `null` platform is significantly low which makes it a good candidate for all use cases where a graphic output is not necessary.

The `webrtc` platform is used by Anbox to provide graphical output. It supports all GPUs supported by Anbox Cloud in addition to software rendering. It is used when a container is launched with `--enable-graphics`, or via the Anbox Stream Gateway.

## Supported APIs

For NVIDIA GPUs Anbox Cloud uses [OpenGL ES 3.2](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/) and [EGL 1.5](https://www.khronos.org/egl/) graphical interfaces. For Intel and AMD GPUs, Anbox Cloud uses [Vulkan 1.3](https://vulkan.org/).
