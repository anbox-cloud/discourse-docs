Anbox Cloud gathers various performance metrics that you can access through API endpoints to create a monitoring solution. See [How to monitor Anbox Cloud](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/monitor-anbox-cloud/24338) for detailed information.

The reference implementation for Prometheus (see [Example: Collect metrics](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/example-collect-metrics/17787)) provides some basic dashboards. You can, however, update them to fit your needs.

The following sections list all metrics returned to Prometheus by the Anbox Cloud services that support Prometheus metrics.

## AMS

The Anbox Management Service provides metrics about the Anbox Cloud cluster (or the Anbox Cloud Application server) and the AMS API access.

### AMS metrics endpoint

You can access the AMS metrics from any machine that is on the same network as your Anbox Cloud installation. Use the following endpoint:

    http://<AMS_server>:<AMS_port>/internal/1.0/metrics

Replace `<AMS_server>` with the IP address of your AMS server, which you can determine by running one of the following commands:

* For a full Anbox Cloud deployment: `juju run --unit ams/0 -- unit-get private-address`
* For the Anbox Cloud Appliance: `juju run -m appliance:anbox-cloud --unit ams/0 -- unit-get private-address`

Replace `<AMS_port>` with the port for the API endpoint, which you can determine by running one of the following commands:

* For a full Anbox Cloud deployment: `juju config ams prometheus_target_port`
* For the Anbox Cloud Appliance: `juju config -m appliance:anbox-cloud ams prometheus_target_port`

You can then access the endpoint with `curl`, for example:

    curl http://192.0.2.55:20002/internal/1.0/metrics

### AMS cluster metrics

Metrics prefixed with `ams_cluster_` keep you informed about the status of your Anbox Cloud cluster.

| Name                                             | Description                                   | Status    |

| `ams_cluster_used_memory_total`                  | Used memory in each worker node               | Available since 1.0.0 |

### AMS API metrics

Metrics prefixed with `ams_http_` allow to track access to the API.
These metrics are available since Anbox Cloud 1.10.0.

| Name                                       | Description                                           |

| `ams_http_response_size_bytes_bucket`      | The HTTP response sizes in bytes                      |

#### API handlers

To give a more granular approach to monitoring, the AMS API metrics contain handlers that identify the kind of API access.

The AMS API can be accessed through HTTP/HTTPS or a Unix domain socket. Therefore, the API metrics distinguish between `http`, `https` and `unix`. For example:

    ams_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="http_applications_GET",host="juju-2db13b-1",method="get",le="0.5"} 1
    ams_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="https_applications_GET",host="juju-2db13b-1",method="get",le="0.5"} 1
    ams_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="unix_applications_GET",host="juju-2db13b-1",method="get",le="0.5"} 1

All handler labels adopt the convention `<transport method>_<object>_<http method>`, for example, `unix_containers_POST`.

The following table contains all routes and their corresponding labels (ignoring the communication method prefix).

| Method  | Route                                       | Label                              |

## Anbox Stream Gateway

The Anbox Stream Gateway provides metrics about the streaming activities of your cluster or server and the Anbox Stream Gateway API access.

### Anbox Stream Gateway endpoint

You can access the Anbox Stream Gateway metrics from any machine that is on the same network as your Anbox Cloud installation. Use the following endpoint:

    https://<gateway_server>:<gateway_port>/internal/1.0/metrics

Replace `<gateway_server>` with the IP address of your Anbox Stream Gateway server, which you can determine by running one of the following commands:

* For a full Anbox Cloud deployment: `juju run --unit anbox-stream-gateway/0 -- unit-get private-address`
* For the Anbox Cloud Appliance: `juju run -m appliance:anbox-cloud --unit anbox-stream-gateway/0 -- unit-get private-address`

Replace `<gateway_port>` with the port for the API endpoint, which you can determine by running one of the following commands:

* For a full Anbox Cloud deployment: `juju config anbox-stream-gateway prometheus_port`
* For the Anbox Cloud Appliance: `juju config -m appliance:anbox-cloud anbox-stream-gateway prometheus_port`

The Anbox Stream Gateway endpoint is on HTTPS, and therefore you must authenticate to access it. You can retrieve the credentials from the `/var/snap/anbox-stream-gateway/common/service/config.yaml` file on the gateway server:

* For a full Anbox Cloud deployment:

  ```
  juju ssh anbox-stream-gateway/0
  sudo cat /var/snap/anbox-stream-gateway/common/service/config.yaml
  ```

* For the Anbox Cloud Appliance:

  ```
  juju ssh -m appliance:anbox-cloud anbox-stream-gateway/0
  sudo cat /var/snap/anbox-stream-gateway/common/service/config.yaml
  ```

You can then access the endpoint with `curl`, for example:

    curl -k -u prometheusadmin:thepassword https://192.0.2.55:9105/internal/1.0/metrics

### Anbox Stream Gateway metrics

Metrics prefixed with `anbox_stream_gateway_` give information about your cluster related to streaming, for example, the number of sessions and agents.
These metrics are available since Anbox Cloud 1.7.2.

| Name                                  | Description                                     |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `anbox_stream_gateway_sessions_total` | Total number of sessions, categorised by status |
| `anbox_stream_gateway_accounts_total` | Total number of accounts                        |
| `anbox_stream_gateway_agents_total`   | Number of active and unresponsive agents        |

### Anbox Stream Gateway API metrics

Metrics prefixed with `anbox_stream_gateway_http_` allow to track access to the streaming API.
These metrics are available since Anbox Cloud 1.9.0.

| Name                                                        | Description                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `anbox_stream_gateway_http_in_flight_requests`              | Number of HTTP requests being processed at the moment |
| `anbox_stream_gateway_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket` | The HTTP request latency in seconds                   |
| `anbox_stream_gateway_http_request_size_bytes_bucket`       | The HTTP request size in bytes                        |
| `anbox_stream_gateway_http_requests_total`                  | Total number of HTTP requests made                    |
| `anbox_stream_gateway_http_response_size_bytes_bucket`      | The HTTP response sizes in bytes                      |

#### API handlers

To give a more granular approach to monitoring, the Anbox Stream Gateway API metrics contain handlers that identify the route that is accessed. The routes are indicated in the handler labels. For example:

    anbox_stream_gateway_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{handler="get_sessions",host="juju-2db13b-1",method="get",le="0.5"} 1

In this case, the label for the route is `get_sessions`.

The following table contains all routes and their corresponding labels.

| Method   | Route                               | Label                        |
|----------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/1.0/status`                       | `get_service_status`         |
| `POST`   | `/1.0/sessions`                     | `create_new_session`         |
| `GET`    | `/1.0/sessions`                     | `get_sessions`               |
| `GET`    | `/1.0/sessions/<id>`                | `get_session`                |
| `DELETE` | `/1.0/sessions/<id>`                | `delete_session`             |
| `DELETE` | `/1.0/sessions`                     | `delete_sessions`            |
| `POST`   | `/1.0/sessions/<id>/join`           | `join_session`               |
| `GET`    | `/1.0/sessions/<id>/sockets/master` | `streaming_websocket_master`  <!-- wokeignore:rule=master --> |
| `GET`    | `/1.0/sessions/<id>/sockets/slave`  | `streaming_websocket_slave`  <!-- wokeignore:rule=slave -->  |
| `GET`    | `/1.0/applications`                 | `get_applications`           |
| `GET`    | `/1.0/regions`                      | `get_regions`                |


## LXD

LXD provides metrics about the LXD cluster that Anbox Cloud uses.

LXD metrics have been available since LXD version 4.19. You cannot access LXD metrics if you are running an older version of LXD.

### LXD metrics endpoint

You can access the LXD metrics through the following endpoint:

     https://<LXD_server>:8443/1.0/metrics

Replace `<LXD_server>` with the IP address of your LXD server, which you can determine by running one of the following commands:

* For a full Anbox Cloud deployment: `juju run --unit lxd/0 -- unit-get private-address`
* For the Anbox Cloud Appliance: `juju run -m appliance:anbox-cloud --unit lxd/0 -- unit-get private-address`

The LXD metrics endpoint is on HTTPS, and therefore you must authenticate to access it. See [Create metrics certificate](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/latest/metrics/#add-a-metrics-certificate-to-lxd) in the LXD documentation for instructions on how to create a certificate.

Alternatively, if you are using the Anbox Cloud Appliance, you can also access the LXD metrics through the local Unix socket. In this case, you don't need authentication. To use this method, enter the following command:

    curl --unix-socket /var/snap/lxd/common/lxd/unix.socket s/1.0/metrics

### LXD metrics

You can find the list of metrics that LXD provides in the [LXD documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/latest/reference/provided_metrics/).

## WebRTC

The WebRTC metrics are collected by Telegraf on every cluster member.

### WebRTC metrics endpoint

You can access the WebRTC metrics as part of the metrics that Telegraf collects and provides to Prometheus. You can access them from any machine that is on the same network as your Anbox Cloud installation. To find the endpoint, check the `/var/snap/anbox-cloud-appliance/common/telegraf/main.conf` file on each cluster member and look for the `listen` address and the `path` in the `[[outputs.prometheus_client]]` section.

You can then access the endpoint with `curl`, for example:

    curl http://192.0.2.1:9001/metrics

### WebRTC metrics

Metrics prefixed with `webrtc_` give you detailed insight about the WebRTC protocol for every streaming instance. See the [official W3C reference](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc-stats) for more information.
These metrics are available since Anbox Cloud 1.8.0.

| Name                                | Description                                                                                                |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `webrtc_frames_encoded`             | Total number of frames successfully encoded                                                                |
| `webrtc_key_frames_encoded`         | Total number of key frames, such as key frames in VP8 or IDR-frames in H.264 (`webrtc_key_frames_encoded - webrtc_frames_encoded` gives the number of delta frames) |
| `webrtc_total_encode_time`          | Total number of seconds that has been spent encoding the `webrtc_frames_encoded` frames (the average encode time can be calculated by dividing this value with `webrtc_frames_encoded`) |
| `webrtc_target_bitrate`             | The current encoder target in bits per second                                                              |
| `webrtc_bytes_sent`                 | Total number of bytes sent for a specific [SSRC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550#section-3) (a SSRC represents one resource - video, audio or binary data - sent over a WebRTC track) |
| `webrtc_retransmitted_bytes_sent`   | Total number of bytes that were re-transmitted for a specific SSRC, only including payload bytes           |
| `webrtc_retransmitted_packets_sent` | Total number of packets that were re-transmitted for a specific SSRC                                       |
| `webrtc_total_packet_send_delay`    | Total number of seconds that packets have spent buffered locally before being transmitted onto the network |
| `webrtc_packets_sent`               | Total number of RTP packets sent for this SSRC (includes re-transmissions)                                 |
| `webrtc_nack_count`                 | Total number of Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) packets received by this sender                            |
| `webrtc_fir_count`                  | Total number of Full Intra Request (FIR) packets received by this sender (video only)                      |
| `webrtc_pli_count`                  | Total number of Picture Loss Indication (PLI) packets received by this sender (video only)                 |
| `webrtc_sli_count`                  | Total number of Slice Loss Indication (SLI) packets received by this sender (video only)                   |
| `webrtc_relay_in_use`               | Boolean value indicating if a relay ICE candidate type is in use for the stream                            |
