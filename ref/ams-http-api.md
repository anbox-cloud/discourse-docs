All the communications between AMS and its clients happen using a  RESTful API over HTTP which is then encapsulated over either TLS for  remote operations or a unix socket for local operations

Not all REST API endpoints require authentication:

* GET to / is allowed for everyone
* GET to /1.0 is allowed for everyone
* GET to /1.0/version is allowed for everyone

Some endpoints require an additional authentication token to ensure that the requester is authorized to access the resource:

* GET to /1.0/artifacts
* PATCH to /1.0/containers/<name>


## API versioning
The details of a version of the api can be retrieved using `GET /<version>`.
For example `GET /1.0`

The reason for a major API bump is if the API breaks backward compatibility.

Feature additions done without breaking backward compatibility only result in addition to `api_extensions` which can be used by the client to check if a given feature is supported by the server.

## Return values
There are three standard return types:

 * Standard return value
 * Background operation
 * Error

### Standard return value
For a standard synchronous operation, the following dict is returned:

```json
{
    "type": "sync",
    "status": "Success",
    "status_code": 200,
    "metadata": {}                          # Extra resource/action specific metadata
}
```

HTTP code must be 200.

### Background operation
When a request results in a background operation, the HTTP code is set to 202 (Accepted)
and the Location HTTP header is set to the operation URL.

The body is a dict with the following structure:

```json
{
    "type": "async",
    "status": "OK",
    "status_code": 100,
    "operation": "/1.0/containers/<id>",                    # URL to the background operation
    "metadata": {}                                          # Operation metadata (see below)
}
```

The operation metadata structure looks like:

```json
{
    "id": "c6832c58-0867-467e-b245-2962d6527876",           # UUID of the operation
    "class": "task",                                        # Class of the operation (task, websocket or token)
    "created_at": "2018-04-02T16:49:36.341463206+02:00",    # When the operation was created
    "updated_at": "2018-04-02T16:49:36.341463206+02:00",    # Last time the operation was updated
    "status": "Running",                                    # String version of the operation's status
    "status_code": 103,                                     # Integer version of the operation's status (use this rather than status)
    "resources": {                                          # Dictionary of resource types (container, snapshots, images) and affected resources
      "containers": [
        "/1.0/containers/3apqo5te"
      ]
    },
    "metadata": null,                                       # Metadata specific to the operation in question (in this case, nothing)
    "may_cancel": false,                                    # Whether the operation can be canceled (DELETE over REST)
    "err": ""                                               # The error string should the operation have failed
}
```

The body is mostly provided as a user friendly way of seeing what's going on without having to pull the target operation, all information in the body can also be retrieved from the background operation URL.

### Error
There are various situations in which something may immediately go wrong, in those cases, the following return value is used:

```json
{
    "type": "error",
    "error": "Failure",
    "error_code": 400,
    "metadata": {}                      # More details about the error
}
```

HTTP code must be one of 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 412 or 500.

## Status codes
The AMS REST API often has to return status information, be that the reason for an error, the current state of an operation or the state of the various resources it exports.

To make it simple to debug, all of those are always doubled. There is a numeric representation of the state which is guaranteed never to change and can be relied on by API clients. Then there is a text version meant to make it easier for people manually using the API to figure out what's happening.

In most cases, those will be called status and `status_code`, the former being the user friendly string representation and the latter the fixed numeric value.

The codes are always 3 digits, with the following ranges:

 * 100 to 199: resource state (started, stopped, ready, ...)
 * 200 to 399: positive action result
 * 400 to 599: negative action result
 * 600 to 999: future use

### List of current status codes

Code  | Meaning
---|------
100   | Operation created
101   | Started
102   | Stopped
103   | Running
104   | Cancelling
105   | Pending
106   | Starting
107   | Stopping
108   | Aborting
109   | Freezing
110   | Frozen
111   | Thawed
200   | Success
400   | Failure
401   | Cancelled

## Recursion
To optimize queries of large lists, recursion is implemented for collections. A `recursion` argument can be passed to a GET query against a collection.

The default value is 0 which means that collection member URLs are returned. Setting it to 1 will have those URLs be replaced by the object they point to (typically a dict).

Recursion is implemented by simply replacing any pointer to a job (URL) by the object itself.

## Async operations
Any operation which may take more than a second to be done must be done in the background, returning a background operation ID to the client.

The client will then be able to either poll for a status update or wait for a notification using the long-poll API.

## Notifications
A websocket based API is available for notifications, different notification types exist to limit the traffic going to the client.

It's recommended that the client always subscribes to the operations notification type before triggering remote operations so that it doesn't have to then poll for their status.

## PUT vs PATCH
The AMS API supports both PUT and PATCH to modify existing objects.

PUT replaces the entire object with a new definition, it's typically called after the current object state was retrieved through GET.

To avoid race conditions, the Etag header should be read from the GET response and sent as If-Match for the PUT request. This will cause AMS to fail the request if the object was modified between GET and PUT.

PATCH can be used to modify a single field inside an object by only specifying the property that you want to change. To unset a key, setting it to empty will usually do the trick, but there are cases where PATCH won't work and PUT needs to be used instead.

## Authorization
Some operation may require a token to be included in the HTTP Authorization header like this:

 * Authorization: bearer <token>

No matter if the request is already authenticated using a trusted certificate. If the token is not valid, the request is rejected by the server. This ensures that only authorized clients can access those endpoints.

## File upload
Some operations require uploading a payload. To prevent the difficulties of handling multipart requests, another solution has been taken: A unique file is uploaded and its bytes are included in the body of the request. Some metadata associated with the file is included in extra HTTP headers:

 * X-AMS-Fingerprint: fingerprint of the payload being added
 * X-AMS-Request: metadata for the payload. This is a JSON, specific for the operation.

#### PATCH (ETag supported)
 * Description: Update existing application
 * Authentication: trusted
 * Operation: sync
 * Cancellable: no

An application can be updated with either a new package or specific fields.
The `Content-Type` header of HTTP patch request is different when uploading
an application in either way.

Update methods            |  Content-Type
----------------|------------------------------------
With a new package |  application/octet-stream
With specified fields        |  application/json

An application package can be uploaded with a bzip2 compressed payload if the former method is taken.

Example
```bash
$ curl -s --header "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" -X PATCH --insecure --cert client.crt --key client.key --data-binary @app_1.tar.bz2 <AMS_SERVICE_URL>/1.0/applications/my-app
```

Output:
```json
{
  "type": "async",
  "status": "Operation created",
  "status_code": 100,
  "operation": "1.0/operations/e1dc826e-8627-4225-94b1-808ac0e40bfb",
  "error_code": 0,
  "error": "",
  "metadata": {

    "class": "task",
    "description": "Updating application",
    "created_at": "2018-07-27T06:18:33.157030462Z",
    "updated_at": "2018-07-27T06:18:33.157030462Z",
    "status": "Running",
    "status_code": 103,
    "resources": {
      "applications": [
        "/1.0/applications/my-app"
      ]
    },
    "metadata": null,
    "may_cancel": true,
    "err": "",
    "server_address": ""
  }
}
```

For the specific field update case, a JSON format payload is accepted.

```json
{
    "tags": [ "game" ],
    "instance-type": "a4.3"
}
```

Example
```bash
$ curl -s --header "Content-Type: application/json" -X PATCH --insecure --cert client.crt --key client.key --data "$payload" <AMS_SERVICE_URL>/1.0/applications/my-app
```

To monitor the status of an application update operation, please refer to [`/1.0/operations`](#heading--10operations)

The following fields can be modified when updating an application. Changing some of those fields will lead to creating another application version.

Supported update field            |   Will create a new application version
----------------|------------------------------------
image |  no
instance-type        |  no
tags | no
addons | no
resources | no
inhibit_auto_updates | no
services | yes
watchdog |yes
boot_activity | yes
required_permissions | yes
video_encoder | yes
manifest_version | yes

To use those fields that would create a new application version on application update, the server requires `application_partial_updates` extension.

#### DELETE

<a name="heading--10events"></a>
### `/1.0/events`
This URL isn't a real REST API endpoint, instead of doing a GET query on it
will upgrade the connection to a websocket on which notifications will
be sent.

#### GET
 * Description: websocket upgrade
 * Authentication: trusted
 * Operation: sync
 * Cancellable: no

URL parameter | Description  |  Optional values
----------------|-------------------|-----------------
type |   comma separated list of notifications to subscribe to (defaults to all) | operation, logging, lifecycle

The notification types are:

 * operation - notification about creation, updates and termination of all background operations
 * logging - every log entry from the server
 * lifecycle - container lifecycle events

As a result,  this API call upgrades the connection to a websocket on which notifications will be sent.

This never returns. Each notification is sent as a separate JSON dict, for example:

```json
{
  "metadata": {                                 // Event metadata
    "class": "task",
    "created_at": "2017-07-28T05:02:22.92201407Z",

### `/1.0/images`
#### GET
 * Description: List available images
 * Authentication: trusted
 * Operation: sync
 * Cancellable: no

Example:
```bash
$ curl -s -X GET --insecure --cert client.crt --key client.key <AMS_SERVICE_URL>/1.0/images
```

Return value:

```json
{
  "type": "sync",
  "status": "Success",
  "status_code": 200,
  "operation": "",
  "error_code": 0,
  "error": "",
  "metadata": [
    "/1.0/images/btavtegj1qm58qg7ru50"
  ]
}
```

#### POST
 * Description: Registers a new image
 * Authentication: trusted
 * Operation: async
 * Cancellable: no

In the HTTP payload upload case, the following headers may be set by the client:

* `Content-Type:`: application/octet-stream (mandatory field)
* `X-AMS-Request`: JSON format metadata (mandatory field)
* `X-AMS-Fingerprint:`: SHA-256 (if set, the uploaded payload must match)

For an image upload, the `X-AMS-Request` header is comprised of:

```
{
    "name": "my-image",  // (string) Image name
    "default": false     // (boolean) Whether the default image to be used by AMS
}
```

The payload to upload must be a tarball compressed with gzip, bzip2 or xz. It must contain a piece of `metadata.yaml` and rootfs for image registration.

Example:
```bash
curl -s --header "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --header 'X-AMS-Request: {"name": "my-image", "default": false}' -X POST --insecure --cert client.crt --key client.key --data-binary @my-image.tar.xz <AMS_SERVICE_URL>/1.0/images
```

#### PATCH (ETag supported)
 * Description: Updates an existing image
 * Authentication: trusted
 * Operation: sync
 * Cancellable: no

An image can be updated with either a new package or specific fields.
The `Content-Type` header of HTTP patch request is different when uploading
an image in either way.

|Update methods|Content-Type|
| --- | --- |
|With a new package|application/octet-stream|
|With specified fields|application/json|

An image package can be uploaded with one of the supported compress format payload(gzip, bzip2 or xz) if the former approach is taken. And X-AMS-Request header is comprised of as follows in this case:

```json
{
    "name": "my-image",  // (string) Image name
    "default": false     // (boolean) Default image setting
}
```

Example:
```bash
$ curl -s --header "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"  --header 'X-AMS-Request: {"name": "my-image", "default": false}' -X PATCH --insecure --cert client.crt --key client.key --data-binary @my-image.tar.bz2 <AMS_SERVICE_URL>/1.0/images/my-image
```

Output:
```json
{
  "type": "async",
  "status": "Operation created",
  "status_code": 100,
  "operation": "1.0/operations/882795ad-6876-46b2-8f32-8226f4b22912",
  "error_code": 0,
  "error": "",
  "metadata": {
    "id": "882795ad-6876-46b2-8f32-8226f4b22912",
    "class": "task",
    "description": "Updating image",
    "created_at": "2018-07-28T08:23:14.253985803Z",
    "updated_at": "2018-07-28T08:23:14.253985803Z",
    "status": "Running",
    "status_code": 103,
    "resources": {
      "images": [
        "/1.0/images/my-image"
      ]
    },
    "metadata": null,
    "may_cancel": true,
    "err": "",
    "server_address": ""
  }
}
```
As a result, a new image version will be generated.

To update an image with a specified field, a JSON format payload is accepted.

```json
{
     "default": true     // (boolean) Default image setting
}
```
URL parameter | Description  |  Optional values
----------------|-------------------|-----------------
type |   comma separated list of notifications to subscribe to (defaults to all) | operation, logging, lifecycle
Example:
```bash
$ curl -s --header "Content-Type: application/json"  -X PATCH --insecure --cert client.crt --key client.key --data "$payload" <AMS_SERVICE_URL>/1.0/images/my-image
```

When updating an image with the above field, no new image version will be generated.

To monitor the status of an image update operation, please refer to [`/1.0/operations`](#heading--10operations)

#### DELETE
 * Description: Remove an existing image
 * Authentication: trusted
 * Operation: async
 * Cancellable: no

In the HTTP image removal case, a JSON format payload input is required from the client:

```Payload
{
    "force": false // (boolean) Forcibly remove the image
}
```

Example:
```bash
curl -s -X DELETE --insecure --cert client.crt --key client.key --data "$payload" <AMS_SERVICE_URL>/1.0/images/my-image
```

<a name="heading--10operationsuuid"></a>
### `/1.0/operations/<uuid>`
#### GET
 * Description: Load operation information. If the service is deployed as
a cluster of several instances, the operation is held in one of them. In
case the request reaches a different instance of the one holding the
operation, the information is taken internally from the right one.
 * Authentication: trusted
 * Operation: sync
 * Cancellable: no

For example, when changing the publication status of an application by issuing
```bash
payload='{"published": false}'
operation=$(curl -s -X PATCH --insecure --cert client.crt --key client.key --data "$payload"  <AMS_SERVICE_URL>/1.0/applications/my-app/0 | jq -r .operation)

    "err": "",
    "server_address": ""
  }
}
```

#### DELETE
 * Description: Cancel an operation. Calling this will change the state of cancellable API to "cancelling" rather than actually removing the entry. If the service is deployed as a cluster of several instances, the operation is held in one of them. In case the request reaches a different instance of the one holding the
operation, the information is taken internally from the right one.
 * Authentication: trusted
 * Operation: sync
 * Cancellable: no

For example, to cancel an operation of an application creation
```bash
operation=$(curl -s --header "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" -X POST
--insecure --cert client.crt --key client.key  --data-binary @my-app.tar.bz2
        <AMS_SERVICE_URL>/1.0/applications | jq -r .operation)

curl -s -X DELETE --insecure --cert client.crt --key client.key <AMS_SERVICE_URL>/$operation| jq .
```

Output:
```json

  "type": "sync",
  "status": "Success",
  "status_code": 200,
  "operation": "",
  "error_code": 0,
  "error": "",
  "metadata": {}
