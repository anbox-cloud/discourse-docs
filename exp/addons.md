Addons provide a way to extend and customise images in Anbox Cloud. Once you have created addons, you can create [hooks](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/28555) for them that are triggered based on events in the life cycle of an [instance](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/26204#instance). You can create addons independently and later attach it to individual applications.

## Best practices while using addons

Addons must be created with careful consideration to not affect performance adversely. A good addon is light-weight and targeted for the necessary applications.

Here are some good practices to consider when creating addons:

### Keep addons light
Addons are executed synchronously. Any addon that performs long-running operations (for example, downloading large files, installing packages on regular instances or querying unresponsive services) will delay an application from starting.

[note type="information" Status="Tip"]Use the `INSTANCE_TYPE` environment variable to run only on the specified instance type. Doing so runs the code in your hooks only when necessary.[/note]

### Use global addons sparingly
Addons that are enabled for all applications can be useful, but they can add up quickly because whenever a global addon gets updated, a new application version is created. So if you use a global addon and that addon gets updated often, the disk capacity fills up fast.

Try to attach addons to individual applications unless you need a [global addon](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/how-to-enable-an-addon-globally/25285).

### Clean up your addons
For base instances, if your addon needs additional tools and dependencies during its installation, make sure you remove them afterwards (as part of the [`post-stop` hook](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/hooks/28555)). This will make your application image lighter and all instances launched from it will start faster.
