Anbox Application Registry (AAR)
================================

The Anbox Application Registry, or *AAR*, provides a central repository
for applications created on Anbox Cloud. Using an AAR is very useful for
larger deployments involving multiple regions, in order to keep
applications in sync.

How does it work
================

You can configure the AMS service to regularly look at an AAR and import
any new application versions found there. When a new application version
is found, AMS starts to import it. Once done, AMS makes it available for
use.

An imported application is immutable and cannot be changed other than
through the AAR itself. If an application is removed from the AAR, it is
removed from AMS on the next update as well.

AMS can act in two different roles when working with the AAR:

-  ``publisher`` - should be related to one AMS unit
-  ``client`` - can be related to many units

The ``publisher`` role allows both read and write access to the AAR. AMS
instances registered as publishers act in ``push`` mode and are meant to
push new applications and updates of these to the AAR so that they can
be consumed by regular read-only ``clients``.

A single AMS instance can act only as a publisher or as a client, but
not both. We recommend you have one publishing AMS instance per
architecture, for example, one for ``amd64`` and one for ``arm64``.
These should not be used to host regular containers but only to manage
applications. Regular users should be directed to AMS instances acting
in ``client`` mode.

Using an AAR
